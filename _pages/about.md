Jason is active in the technical community as a writer and speaker. He has delivered talks at Microsoft //Build (2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015), Tech Ed North America, Tech Ed Europe, internal Microsoft conferences, and many .NET user groups.

As a working programmer, Jason is a solutions-driven leader bringing products to market in a cost-effective and team-led way. He enjoyes being engaged in the full end-to-end experience of delivering a product, including working with customers and partners, communicating with internal teams, and driving good cross-group collaboration in delivering a high quality product. Jason is primarily a self-taught fast learner that really enjoys learning new technologies in new spaces and growing new skills. He really enjoys work that requires team work, communication skills, cross-discipline interaction, influencing, and leadership.
