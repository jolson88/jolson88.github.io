title: I, Microsoftie
---

 <p>
   I can now finally blog the big news that I've been _dying_ to share with everyone.
   I'm proud to announce that I will soon officially become a Microsoft employee. I have
   accepted an offer to be a Technical Evangelist on the Developer and Platform Evangelism
   Team working with Longhorn Server. That's right, baby! Technical Evangelist!!! I'm
   really looking forward to the challenge, the never-stop-learning experience, and everything
   else about the position.
</p>
<p>
   I feel so lucky that I will be getting the opportunity to work with amazingly smart
   people such as (in no special order): <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/">Vitorrio
   Bertocci</a>, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/volkerw/">Volker Will</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamescon/">James
   Conard</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/default.aspx">Matthew Winkler</a>,
   and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/neilhut/default.aspx">Neil Hutson</a> (the ones
   I met during my interview loop).
</p>
<p>
   I would like to send out a thank you to Steve Cellini for giving me my final interview
   and providing me with some more insight into what the purpose of Evangelism is.
</p>
<p>
   I also would be remiss to not send a "shout out" to Steph Coleman, the recruiter who
   recruited me in the first place, and without whom this would not be happening to me
   at this time :). I will be creating a new post detailing my recruiting experience
   and how the whole process went (so stay tuned).
</p>
<p>
   So, thank all of you for the opportunity and I look forward to working with all of
   you!
