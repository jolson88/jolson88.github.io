title: Meltdown - Best Practices for Windows Game Development

<p>
   Interesting. All power point reading, but interesting nonetheless. I just hope there
   is some "meat" to some of these talks rather than just power point, power point, and
   more power point. I must take this opportunity to say that after seeing Scott Hanselman
   talk so many times, I'm an absolute spoiled brat when it comes to presentations. I
   find that I'm very picky about good presentations and certain things (like power point
   reading) annoy me greatly. At least there's some content here though.

   One thing I find especially interesting is how specialized DirectX is becoming. What
   I mean by that is how many DirectX elements are becoming deprecated. From the sounds
   of it, DirectX is basically being wittled down to Direct3D and DirectSound. Here are
   the state of the other APIs that I know of:
</p>
<p>
   1) DirectDraw - Deprecated
</p>
<p>
   2) DirectMusic - Deprecated
</p>
<p>
   3) DirectPlay - Deprecated
</p>
<p>
   4) DirectShow - Not recommended for game development
</p>
<p>
   5) DirectInput - Although it is not officially deprecated, it is highly recommended
   to simply use the Windows hooks instead of DirectInput. 
</p>
<p>
   I have a feeling there will be many interesting issues I will see in the next day
   or two regarding the direction that DirectX is heading.
