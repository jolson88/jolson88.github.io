   Hello everyone, and welcome back to &nbsp;the “Feature Of The Week” newsletter. This
   week, we take quick dive into some of the enhancements that have been made to Windows
   Error Reporting (WER) in Vista and Longhorn Server. 
<p>
   <b>What is Windows Error Reporting (WER)? </b>Windows Error Reporting enables users
   to notify Microsoft of application faults, kernel faults, and unresponsive applications.
   Microsoft can use the error reporting feature to provide customers with troubleshooting
   information, solutions, or updates for their specific problems. Developers can use
   this infrastructure to receive information that can be used to improve their applications.<b> </b>

   <b>What’s new in Windows Error Reporting? </b>Windows Error Reporting isn’t actually
   new to Vista and Longhorn Server. However, there are some pretty cool enhancements
   to Windows Error Reporting that you can find in Vista and Longhorn Server. Developers
   can use the new API to create reports for many types of events, not just applications
   crashes and hangs. Also, developers can now create custom reports, customize the reporting
   user interface, and submit reports to Microsoft. Using Windows Quality Online Services,
   they then can access their report data, create solutions, and deliver these solutions
   to their users.
