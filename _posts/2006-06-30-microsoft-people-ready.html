title: Microsoft - People Ready

   <p>
      I've had a random thought of an experiment/observation I want to make when I start
      at Microsoft.
   </p>
   <p>
      Lately, I've seen a good number of commercials on this whole "People Ready" marketing
      theme by Microsoft. One of the commercials shows a "new guy" who just started at a
      company and what he is going through. The gist? To being able to empower your employees
      to excel as a company.
   </p>
   <p>
      So, the observation I want to make? Well, with all the "People Ready" marketing, can
      Microsoft "walk the walk" and "talk the talk"? Stay tuned to see if they can!
