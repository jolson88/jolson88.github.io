title: I love correspondence chess!
---

For all the casual chess players out there, you should really try correspondence chess. It rocks!!!! It's much more casual and it's not nearly as time-consuming as OTB play. I already have a banner for GameKnot on the left that you can see. I found a new site (thanks Tryfon!!!!) that seems to have a lot more members and functionality. The site is <A href="http://www.letsplaychess.com/chessclubs/asplogin.asp?from=108764">ChessWorld.net</A> and full membership is only $19/year which is next to nothing. Please use me as a referrer if you decide to join (my nickname is JasonOlson (not exactly original,&nbsp;I know))&nbsp;;). You can do that by clicking on the link above or following the banner on the left. Enjoy!!!<img src ="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/6084.aspx" width = "1" height = "1" />
