title: Microsoft Gets It Wrong, Again?
---

<p>
   If there is one thing that bothers me most about good terminology in computer programming,
   it is that if they are *too* good they become mere marketing buzz words. Key example:
   refactoring. I hear EVERYONE use this now even when it has nothing to do with what
   they are talking about. There are developers I know (thank goodness I don't work with
   any of them at Fios) where anytime they go in to legacy code to make a change, they
   refer to it as "refactoring" the code. Kuso! It just bugs the beejeebeez out of me.
</p>
<p>
   Anyways, in that same vein, imagine my "surprise" (insert incredible amount of sarcasm
   and disdain here) when I found this post by Jim Shore in which he points to a MS guide
   on doing TDD with Team System. The problem? What they are describing, while having
   elements *similar* to TDD, is *NOT* TDD. I wouldn't usually mind this. But come on,
   call a spade a spade. If it's not TDD, don't use the term TDD simply because it's
   a "buzz word" of the day.
</p>
<p>
   The more scarier possibility is that the author of the article (whoever it was) actually
   that it *was* TDD. There has been a lot of research and writings produced on the topic
   of TDD. How can it be so wrong?
</p>
<p>
   Rather than me trying to add value to this whole debate (which I have none), I confer
   to the wisdom of some of the greats in this arena.
