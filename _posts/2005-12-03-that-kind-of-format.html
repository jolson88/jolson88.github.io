   FORMAT C:\ that is.

   Yup, it's about that time. I fubared my computer a bit when I started doing OS development
   (I wasn't exactly smart about it when I first started). Ever since then, I get random
   restarts anywhere from every couple of hours to once every couple of days. I sent
   in a couple reports with Dr. Watson but nothing was identified as being the problem.

   Oh well, at least I do backups. It's not such a pain to do this reformatting every
   once in a while. However, this time does have me thinking about perhaps going out
   and getting Ghost to make this process even easier.

   So, I suppose I will see you all on the other side. Until then, my friends!!!
