title: 'LHS Feature Of The Week #3 - Transactional Registry'

<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hello everyone, and welcome back to &nbsp;the “Feature Of The Week” newsletter. In
   this week’s newsletter, we will continue on the “Transactions Bandwagon” by discussing
   the Transactional Registry. This newsletter will be short and sweet as, truth be told,
   this feature still needs to have a bit more documentation than it has today. 
<p>
   So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the Longhorn Server Feature Of The Week! 
<p>
   <b>What is the Transactional Registry? </b>The Transactional Registry (TxR) is an
   enhancement to the Registry that allows all registry operations to be performed within
   the scope of a transaction. This is made possible by a new transaction infrastructure
   in the kernel that allows operating system services to participate in transactions
   via the new Kernel Transaction Manager. 
<p>
   <b></b> 
<p>
   <b>What scenarios does this enable? </b>The Transactional Registry (TxR) is also fully
   capable of communicating with the MS Distributed Transaction Coordinator, meaning
   that TxR operations can participate in transactions that are leveraging any other
   Resource Manager that DTC is capable of working with. What does this mean to you?
   It means that you can now have an application that not only encompasses database calls,
   operations to the file system, as well as operations to the Registry. 
<p>
   <b><i>Preview</i></b>: Next week we will take a look at the technology that makes
   the Transactional NTFS and Registry possible: the Kernel Transaction Manager. Stay
   stuned!
