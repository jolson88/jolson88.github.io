title: Presenting Data and Information
---

<P><EM>First of all, thanks for the link <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=971d3ab8-af8f-45ef-9fc4-993a30dba0d0">Scott</A>!!</EM></P>
<P>Well, I'm now registered to attend the course &#8220;Presenting Data and Information&#8221; by Edward Tufte. This course is *highly* recommended by many software engineers that I know. If you would like to attend yourself, you can find information at <A href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses">http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses</A>.</P>
<P>I'm just hoping that I indeed did get my registration in on time. Even with the online registration, they &#8220;snail-mail&#8221; the confirmation to you. I'm hoping the registration site is robust enough that it won't let people register if there aren't any slots left. Considering that I *really* want to attend this one-day course, I will definitely be keeping my fingers crossed until I get the confirmation. </P>
