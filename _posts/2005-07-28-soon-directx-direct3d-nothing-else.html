title: Soon, DirectX = Direct3D + nothing else?
---

<p>
   Well, I wasn't going to blog about this because I thought it was under NDA. But considering
   the following information is available in the publicly available slides that you can
   download from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx">DirectX MSDN</a> site,
   I figure that I can blog about it just fine since it's available for the public.
</p>
<p>
   If you look for the slide called "Deprecated Components" in the "DirectX SDK Roadmap"
   talk, you will notice that most of the components will become deprecated (including
   DirectInput and DirectSound). In fact, it looks like the only major component of DirectX
   left is Direct3D, everything else will soon officially become deprecated. Interesting,
   I must say.
</p>
<p>
   I can't share the other nugget with you though because it's not in the slides posted
   on the site. Oh well, perhaps it won't be too long before I can share the information....
