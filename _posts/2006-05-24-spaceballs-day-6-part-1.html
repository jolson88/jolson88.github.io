title: Spaceballs - Day 6, Part 1
---

<p>
   Although I didn't give an update yesterday, I did get some work done. Even though
   I've had the last several days off of work, I'm sure Chris would feel more comfortable
   knowing that I haven't been spending my entire days working on Spaceballs (I have
   a feeling that Chris would only feel truly comfortable if I dropped out of the competition
   since he knows he's fighting a losing battle). 
</p>
<p>
   My spaceship is all hooked up and working. It drives off the mouse and can rotate
   both directions just fine. I just finished hooking up the bullets. Now you can hit
   the spacebar to fire and the bullet will fly in whatever direction the ship is/was
   facing. 
</p>
<p>
   To limit the sheer number of bullets (and to add another game mechanic), I went ahead
   and added a firing rate to the ship (or, more specifically, the weapon). If I have
   the time to implement three different ships like I want to, each one will have a different
   firing rate to differentiate the behavior and strategies for each different ship type.
</p>
<p>
   Before I move on to hooking up an enemy and getting collision detection working, I
   need to do some cleanup refactoring. I also need to do some "bulking up" of my infrastructure
   to make sure that the game continues to be easy to develop. 
</p>
<p>
   After I had removed it earlier, I'm thinking of re-introducing the messaging system
   since I don't like how coupled my various classes are getting. I'm holding off on
   that now though as I really don't want to push it too far if it isn't necessary. I
   figure that I'll actually just continue to push forward and if my coupling becomes
   worse, then I will revisit the topic. There might be other ways though that I can
   manage the dependencies and coupling without introducing an entire message system.
   I'll have to do some more thinking on that.
</p>
<p>
   Well, I'm back off to coding. I'll try to get in another update before I go to bed
   tonight (hence the "Part 1" in the title :)). I'll feel a lot better about the progress
   in the game once I get an enemy and collision detection hooked up. I know it's only
   Day 6, but once an enemy and collision detection is hooked up, I'll be a heck of a
   lot closer to having an entire tracer bullet hooked up.
