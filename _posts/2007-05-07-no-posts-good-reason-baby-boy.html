<p>
   I know, no posts in a while. There's a good reason though: last night, at 10:32pm,
   my wife gave birth to our beautiful baby son. He weighed 8lbs 13oz, and measured 20.5
   inches. The name isn't "official" yet,&nbsp;but we are leaning strongly towards "Alexander
   Lewis Olson". Needless to say, I'm just soaking it all in and enjoying fatherhood. 
</p>

   Once we are out of the hospital (we wanted a home birth, so long story), I'll write
   up a longer post with our birth story. It was filled with all sorts of turns and changes,
   but it ended well, so we are happy :). 
</p>
<p>
   And with that, I leave you with some pictures of our beautiful baby boy. Sorry about
   the size of the pictures, but I'm a bit too pre-occupied to resize them right now
   :).
