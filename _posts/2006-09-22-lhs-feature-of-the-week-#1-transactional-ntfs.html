   Hello everyone, and welcome to the “Feature Of The Week” newsletter. In the Feature
   Of The Week Newsletter, we visit a new feature coming in Longhorn Server every week.
   The goal is that these are nice, short, and efficient to minimize the amount of effort
   required by you, the reader. With every Feature Of The Week, we will provide links
   to more resources in case you want to spend more time diving into the feature covered. 
<p>
   So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the Longhorn Server Feature Of The Week! 
<p>
   <b>What is Transactional NTFS? </b>Transactional NTFS is an enhancement to NTFS that
   allows all file operations on an NTFS file system volume to be performed within the
   scope of a transaction. This is made possible by a new transaction infrastructure
   in the kernel that allows operating system services to participate in transactions
   via the new Kernel Transaction Manager. 
<p>
   <b>What scenarios does this enable?</b> Transactional NTFS is also fully capable of
   communicating with the MS Distributed Transaction Coordinator, meaning that TxF operations
   can participate in transactions that are leveraging any other Resource Manager that
   DTC is capable of working with. What does this mean to you? It means that you can
   now have an application that not only encompasses database calls, but also operations
   to the file system as well (think of Document Management solutions). With transaction
   enhancements being made to the new SMB 2.0 protocol, you can also now contain distributed
   file operations within a transaction as well.
