<p>
   I am starting a new category/feature on this blog. It is something that I've started
   to do internally and I hope to share with all of you :).
</p>
<p>
   The feature is called the Longhorn Server Feature of the Week. Every Friday, I will
   talk about a new/enhanced feature coming with Vista or Longhorn Server. They will
   be nice, short, and sweet. The goal is to make them short so that it doesn't take
   hardly time at all to read it, and will provide links to follow up on if you want
   to do some more investigation regarding the feature. 
</p>
<p>
   So, with that said, I'm going to post both last week's feature and this week's feature
   in a few moments. 
</p>
<p>
   Enjoy :).
