title: Goodbye Amsterdam
---

<p>
   Well, my trip to Amsterdam is almost over. I was here in Amsterdam to do some training
   of trainers for an upcoming Longhorn Server event that we (DPE @ Microsoft) will be
   launching world-wide in the coming months. 
</p>
<p>
   I knew there were going to be some "big" types of names here, but I don't think I
   fully understood what that meant :P. There were several MS Regional Directors at the
   events, countless MS MVPs, and other highly-respected trainers from all over the globe
   (about 32 people in total). I'm also proud to say that I finally get to meet Christian
   Weyer in person (and have a beer (or two (or three (or four))) with him). What a fun
   gun. And he's just as smart as he seems online. It was a blast chatting about TxF
   with him on several occasions.
</p>
<p>
   Considering it was the first "major event" I talked at, I thought it went decently
   well. I tag-teamed with Keith Brown from Pluralsight (another pleasure, that's for
   sure). I gave four talks in total: High Performance Computing and Compute Cluster
   Server 2003, Windows Virtualization Roadmap (including Windows Server Virtualization),
   Transactional NTFS (my favorite, but I'm a little biased), and Terminal Services in
   Longhorn Server. 
</p>
<p>
   I definitely don't know enough about HPC. While I was able to answer some questions,
   I have a very high-level knowledge of HPC so I wasn't able to answer most of the in-depth
   questions. Windows Virtualization Roadmap went well. I just love this stuff. I love
   talking about Ring Compression and the new Virtualization hardware assists that are
   coming (and the like). I'm hoping to work up some demos before I present this again
   in Singapore next week. Perhaps some two demos using PowerShell: one using CmdLets
   to add new virtual machines into Virtual Server, and the other one about building
   a PS provider that allows you to browse Virtual Server -&gt; Virtual Machine -&gt;
   Virtual Properties by "dir" and "cd" and the like :). 
</p>
<p>
   The Transactional NTFS talk went well, but that was the talk I was least concerned
   about. Since I have been living in TxF land for a bit now, I'm comfortable talking
   about all the issues for it. In the future, I want to make some demos that are more
   sexy for TxF. I'm also thinking about possibly coming up with a demo scenario I can
   use to help tell the TxF Story. The funny part is that&nbsp;I realized I'm missing
   some slides. I realize this because there were several questions that came up from
   the audience that would have been addressed directly by some of the slides I had removed.
   Oops :).
</p>
<p>
   Last was the Terminal Services in Longhorn Server talk. Ouch! This talk is nowhere
   near technical enough, nor developer-oriented enough. It's my own fault though since
   I "put together" the deck for the Touchdown program. I'm hoping to get a team member
   back in Redmond to mail the latest LHS build to me in Singapore so I can setup a Virtual
   Machine in order to write up some demos and show off features like TS-Remote Programs.
   We'll see how that situation works out.
</p>
<p>
   That's about it. I managed to take some pictures while I was here, so I will try to
   put them up when I get back to Seattle (or if I can find time while I'm in Singapore).
