title: Pre-Meltdown Hang
---

<p>
   Well, tonight was the pre-Meltdown hang. Before the hang actually started, Andy Dunn
   called me up and we decided to walk over and check out the <a href="http://www.spl.org/default.asp?pageID=branch_central_history&amp;branchID=1">Seattle
   Public Library</a> whose architecture is talked about widely, evidently. All I could
   think of was "what a funny looking building." However, it really is incredible. Starting
   on like the 4th floor, all the books are on a "spiral" where there really isn't any
   "floors" per se. It's basically one continuous spiral up many floors. Pretty trippy
   to see that. Anyways, after that we hiked back to the hotel.
</p>
<p>
   The hang was fun. Free drinks and food. Had a good time with Andy, Chris, Jessica,
   and Todd. It was great after a couple of beers to get&nbsp;Andy talking about us speaking
   "American" and him actually talking English, and about the fact that *WE* are the
   ones&nbsp;with the accents (after all, *THEY* are English and it is their language).
   And then I knew something that would REALLY get him started. So I bated him by saying
   that what is really messed up is how Football is not Football. OHHHHHHH, good times.
</p>
<p>
   He said something at one point that was pretty darn crazy. I mentioned I was going
   to blog about it and everyone started laughing. Luckily for Andy, I have a REALLY
   bad memory and can't even remember what it was (if you're reading this Chris and can
   remember what it was, make sure to leave a comment).
</p>
<p>
   OH, and Chris was recognized by the ladies heading up the door to the bar. Pretty
   crazy. He's all famous and crap because of the stuff he went through to get here.
   JEALOUS.
