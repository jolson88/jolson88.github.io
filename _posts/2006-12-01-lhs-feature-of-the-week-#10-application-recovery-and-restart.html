<p>
   Hello everyone, and welcome back to &nbsp;the “Feature Of The Week” newsletter. This
   week’s newsletter will be short and sweet. We will go over the new Application Recovery
   and Restart API. The API itself is very small and very simple to use (which, in my
   opinion, is “A Good Thing” TM). 
</p>
<p>
   <b>What is Application Recovery and Restart?&nbsp; </b>Application Recovery is a set
   of technologies that give applications the opportunity to control what actions are
   taken on their behalf by the system when they (the application) fail. 
<p>
   If the application registers a callback with the RegisterApplicationRecoveryCallback
   function, the system will execute the recovery callback on application failure. The
   application can that take action to do things like attempting to recover documents.
   If the application has not registered for recovery, the system attempts to diagnose
   and report the problem. 
<p>
   If the application registered a callback with the RegisterApplicationRestart function,
   the system will automatically restart the application after the recovery or diagnosis
   is completed. If the application has not registered for restart, the system will simply
   close the application.
