   I guess I truly can't deny that I was able to create another human being now :). My
   wife and I just got back from our 12th week appointment with the mid-wife. Everything's
   a-okay. Rebecca is perfectly healthy and doing well. The bonus? Today we got to hear
   the baby's heartbeat!!!! Man, I'm totally on Cloud 9 right now. I can't believe I
   just heard our baby's heartbeat.
</p>
<p>
   There's like a little human being in there living and growing :). The miracle of life
   is, well, miraculous. Okay, that's pretty cheesy. I admit I'm no elegant linguist
   like <a href="http://www.neopoleon.com">Rory</a>, but still, I'm going to share my
   excitement in my own kind of way :).
</p>
<p>
   So, after today, I'm one step closer to my goal:
</p>
<p>
   Step 1. <strike>Get wife pregnant</strike>
</p>
<p>
   Step 2. <strike>Hear baby's heartbeat</strike>
</p>
<p>
   ....
</p>
<p>
   ....
</p>
<p>
   ....
</p>
<p>
   Step 125. ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US!!!
