title: VM rootkits
---

 <p>
   I'm sure that many geeks remember the whole Sony Rootkit fiasco that happened not
   too long ago. I'm sure many people had the seem feeling that I did that it was not
   going to be the last time we heard about "rootkits" (and that we would probably be
   hearing even more about them in the future). The work that Mark Russinovich did during
   the Sony Rootkit debacle is stuff that I still look up to, in a big way. It was yet
   another data point that helped fuel my desire to learn the internals of Windows and
   to get a more solid understanding of how everything works.

   Anyways, I digress as I'm being a bit tangential.

   Some of the cool new features that are starting to pique my interest in Longhorn Server
   are the new hardware-based virtualization features that are being made possible by
   technologies like LaGrande (Intel) and Pacifica (AMD). These features could really
   start to help fuel the fight in IT departments around the industry to leverage virtualization
   packages to help control various operational costs. In my opinion, this is "A Good
   Thing." What's interesting though are the holes this technology might open up for
   various malware authors.

   100% undetectable malware? According to <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1983037,00.asp">this
   recent article</a>, not only is it possible, but there is already an example out there
   showing how it can be done. I would be interested to see what some of the brain trust
   within Microsoft is thinking in regards to stopping these sort of attack vectors.
   Currently, Vista is set to release and be one of the most secure Windows OS's that
   we have ever seen. It would be unfortunate if all the work to harden the Windows Kernel
   would go to waste due to an open attack vector made possible by the new virtualization
   technologies.
</p>
<p>
   My worry? If not careful, this could undermine the work that is being done to secure
   Vista in the eyes of the customers. I remember seeing in a previous article or two
   that there is a "Anti-Malware Technology Team" at Microsoft. I would have to imagine
   (or perhaps "radically hope" depending on your optimism or pessimism) that this team
   at Microsoft has started to think about this problem (and hopefully work on it).
