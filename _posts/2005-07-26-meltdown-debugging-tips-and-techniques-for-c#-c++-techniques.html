title: Meltdown - Debugging Tips and Techniques for C#/C++ Techniques
---

<p>
   While I found this talk interesting, it was a little off base. What it should have
   been titled was "New Debugging Features in Visual Studio 2005 for Managed Languages."
   What makes this especially funny for me is that a couple of things happened:
</p>
<p>
   1) The talk started 10 minutes late
</p>
<p>
   2) At the beginning of the talk, he asked how many C# developers there were and only
   six or seven of us raised our hands (there are maybe 40-50 developers in the room).
</p>
<p>
   3) Knowing that only 10% of us are Managed developers, he then goes on to talk about
   writing new visualizers and the like (which is NOT available for native C++ developers
   (as I understand it)). That seemed a bit weird to me. If you're not going to use the
   information at all, why ask the question (especially when it can negate the purpose
   of your whole talk)?
</p>
<p>
   Anyways, yeah, I've seen all this stuff at Tech Ed so nothing new here for me. I was
   hoping it would be a lot lower level since this is largely a development-oriented
   conference and most of the developers (at least it seems) are C++ developers. Oh well,
   c'est la vie!
