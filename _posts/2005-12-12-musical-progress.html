   Well, I got some more studio gear in last Friday. I got a new pair of Studio Monitors
   and nice Condenser Mic. Along with the software I have I am almost done. Well, now
   that I have a lot of the gear I decided to put together an arrangement together. It's
   still *extremely* rough. There is no real mixing, or EQ work done yet. The drum track
   is laugh-out loud funny and the sound I'm using for the bass is hilarious. There is
   also a lot of polishing work that needs to be done with the piano. There are of course
   complete missing tracks right now (like a good acoustic guitar track). I'm basically
   one piece of software short of really filling out the tune.

   Anyways, I thought I would share it with all of you. This is the first time that I'm
   really sharing "my" music that hits close to home so take it easy on me :).
