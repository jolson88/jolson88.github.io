title: Spaceballs - Day 4
---

<p>
   Well, SDL.NET is completely ripped out. Spaceballs is running entirely on GDI+. Believe
   it or not, I ended up ripping out the entire Messaging system as well. I'm not entirely
   sure that it is really even needed for this game. In fact, I think it probably _is_
   quite overkill. 
</p>
<p>
   It's funny, I always get a tingle when ripping out a bunch of code and making the
   code a lot simpler. I'm still happy as the components are pretty isolated and are
   still enabled to be unit tested fairly easily. 
</p>
<p>
   I think that tomorrow I will crank out a quick and dirty Sprite class built directly
   on a Bitmap and use that for rendering. I only hope that the rotation capabilities
   of that or significantly better than that of SDL.NET. Once the Sprite class is built,
   I will hook up the ship into my PlayController. After that, on to one small enemy
   :).
</p>
<p>
   As for Visual C# Express, I have noticed a couple of things. For one, I wish there
   were more refactorings than Rename and ExtractMethod. Also, I do wish they would have
   kept the add-in capabilities enabled. While Jamie Cansdale has done a wonderful job
   getting TestDriven.NET to work, I have had no end of trouble trying to get "Test With...
   Debugger" working. Arg!!! It's frustrating enough that I do wish I was in Visual Studio.
   But that may also be because I like to have my unit tests, darn it :). 
</p>
<p>
   At least after all of this I am only a single day behind schedule. Hopefully I don't
   run into this again. One thing I have noticed after todays efforts? I'm pleasantly
   surprised to see how easy GDI+ programming is. 
</p>
<p>
   As much as I feel ashamed to admit it, I've _never_ written a C# game using GDI+.
   I've always jumped to Managed DirectX (or some pre-packaged library like Irrlicht)
   and only gotten a fraction into the game development process. I'm starting to get
   the impression that now that I've chosen GDI+, this whole process should go a bit
   smoother. My other hope is that this will ultimately make the code a lot more accessible
   to others out there as a lot of the necessary support architecture that one has to
   put in place with Managed DirectX is not there.
</p>
<p>
   I'm glad that at this point I'm still having fun. We'll see if that's still true in
   a week :).&nbsp;
