title: Feedback Wanted - Favorite Development Features in Vista/Longhorn Server
---

<p>
   Howdy all y'all. I'm hoping to get some feedback from all of you. Basically, I'm hoping
   to get a "reader's braindump" on what development features you are looking forward
   to most in Vista/Longhorn Server. So, what development features are you looking forward
   to most in Vista/Longhorn Server? Feel free to just leave a comment (nice and easy-like)
   :).
