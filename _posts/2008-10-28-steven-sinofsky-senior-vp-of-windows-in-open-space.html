I just got word that Day 2 of the PDC (that's Tuesday), at 12:45pm, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ssinofsky/">Steven Sinofsky</a> will be giving a 30 minute Open Space session on "Windows 7 Keynote Discussion." </p>  <p>Yes, that's correct. The Senior Vice President of Windows and Windows Live will be in Open Space at 12:45pm to discuss with you, our customers, what you think about the announcements made in Tuesday morning's keynote on Windows 7. </p>  <p>So if you want to get the ear of the man in charge of Windows (who only answers to Steve Ballmer himself), make sure to drop by Open Space Tuesday afternoon at 12:45pm to partake in what is sure to be a great discussion!</p> <img src="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/126274.aspx" width="1" height="1" />
