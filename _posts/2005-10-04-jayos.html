<p>
   [UPDATE: It looks as though the name JayOS is already taken. Now time to find a new
   name =P]
</p>

   Okay, I just did some chatting with Blogus Maximus and I've gotten back into the mood
   to write on this blog (for the time being at least). I've been too much of a lazy
   bastard lately. Of course, I'm just the kind of person who likes to go in his cave
   and not interact with the rest of the world. So having me blog in the first place
   is its own sort of Christmas-day Miracle (except for the fact that it's neither Christmas
   or a real Miracle). 
</p>
<p>
   So, what have I been up to? Well, I'm finally starting to settle into my new position
   at work. It's a bit daunting at times to be in charge of a team. I know it's helped
   me identify some problems I have and some short comings I need to make up for as a
   leader. Other than that, my personal projects have largely been World of Warcraft
   and my current "baby" project.
</p>
<p>
   Before I talk about my new baby, I should confess (as if you don't already know) that
   I don't exactly follow through on private projects. Following through at work isn't
   a problem, but I get passionate about something at home and then when the passion
   goes away, I move on to my "next thing." Instead of getting down on myself for that,
   I'm just going to say screw it and do it. I don't care what any of you think (of course,
   I'm just kidding there because I love every single one of you (except maybe *one*
   person out there (yeah, you know who you are (or perhaps you don't since I'm just
   making that up in the first place)))). 
</p>
<p>
   So, my new baby is JayOS. I've been wanting to get into low-level programming for
   quite a while. Some may think I'm simply torturing myself (especially those who *had*
   to do it for work in the past) but I find it is something that I enjoy. I enjoy knowing
   how something works and why. In that sense, I have gotten into Operating System development
   lately. It's certainly forced me to learn about how the BIOS works and to learn pedal-to-the-metal
   assembly programming. So far I have my own bootloader that actually loads the kernel
   I wrote in C. Of course, the kernel just prints "Welcome to JayOS" to the screen,
   but it's certainly a start. You don't realize how much you don't know until you start
   trying to do these kinds of things, that's for sure.
</p>
<p>
   I think the first time I realized what I got myself into when starting JayOS was when
   I started writing the Kernel. Since the kernel was in C, I went to write "malloc"
   and then I realized there IS NO malloc. Since malloc is part of the runtime library,
   and since I'm writing my own OS, there is no malloc :). So, I had to write my own
   routine to allocate memory. Of course this has lead me down the road to investigate
   all sorts of memory management schemes. Oh boy, was that a never-ending rabbit hole.
   And that was simply one rabbit-hole of many when it comes to OS development. I've
   enjoyed it though :).
</p>
<p>
   Anyways, that's what I, your most favorite and endearing slacker, have been up to
   lately. Ciao!
