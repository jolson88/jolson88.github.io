title: No I'm Not Dead
---

<p>
   <a href="http://www.blogusmaximus.com/">Mr. Maximus</a> left a comment on my last
   post asking me to at least let people know that I'm still alive. Yes, I'm still alive.
   Yes, I'm spending a bit of my time still playing World of Warcraft. If you're a player,
   you can catch me on the Skywall realm and I am a Troll Mage named Mahku. 
</p>
<p>
   However, WoW isn't the only thing consuming my time. I have been moving into a new
   position at work. I am now an official "team lead" for the Production Systems team.
   It feels kind of funny (and it does come with more responsibility) but it feels really
   great. 
</p>
<p>
   Outside of work and WoW, I've started messing around with wcurses and Python programming.
   The goal is to mess around writing a text-based rpg like Chris Williams has (based
   on the Rifts universe). However, I am merely doing it as a learning tool to learn
   Python better. Why? Because I feel like it damnit!! No really, the reason I'm learning
   Python is because a couple of coworkers and me are starting to put together a set
   of Python libraries to help troubleshoot production support issues. Why Python? Because
   it is a scripting language, and because it is has a lot of community support. 
</p>
<p>
   So that's what's going on. Not much but a lot at the same time. Take it easy peeps.
