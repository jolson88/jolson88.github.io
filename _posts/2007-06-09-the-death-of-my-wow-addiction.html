title: The death of my WoW addiction

<p>
   Well, it's official, again, for now. I just went and canceled my WoW account. With
   the birth of my first child, I have come to the realization that I don't have enough
   time for WoW (or, better put, what time I do have should be spent either with my son,
   or doing a hobby that's creative and produces results I can show off). 
</p>
<p>
   What's funny is that I don't miss it in the least bit. At first, I made the decision
   to stop playing WoW because I simply had to play games where I could pause at a moment's
   notice to help out with Baby Xander. Then, after several weeks of not playing WoW,
   I realized I didn't miss it at all and have really enjoyed spending time either with
   music, or in doing Windows system programming in C (yeah, I'm a geek, I know it). 
</p>
<p>
   So, I say farewell to World of Warcraft for the third time in my life. Hopefully this
   is for good (or until the _next_ expansion pack comes out :P).

   P.S. Back to reading my current book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Windows-Internals-Fourth-Pro-Developer/dp/0735619174/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-4835076-9644848?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1181370049&amp;sr=8-1">Windows
   Internals</a>.
