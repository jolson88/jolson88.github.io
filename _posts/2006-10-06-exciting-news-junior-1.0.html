title: Exciting News! Junior 1.0
---

<p>
   Well, I have some exciting news to share with everyone who reads this (all three of
   you (Hi Mom!)). I've been about ready to burst, but my wife and I wanted to wait until
   we were a ways into "the project." 
</p>
<p>
   So, about eight weeks ago or so, we found out my wife is pregnant (FINALLY!). She
   is almost 11 weeks in. In fact, the next time we get together with the midwife this
   coming Thursday, we may even be able to hear the baby's heartbeat!!! Of course, with
   how long we've been trying (three-four years now?), it still seems too good to be
   true.
</p>
<p>
   While I'm looking forward to the next 6-7 months, I'm DYING to hold our baby in my
   arms :D. Oh boy, my life is going to change in ways I can't even imagine, and I am
   friggen' ecstatic about it!
