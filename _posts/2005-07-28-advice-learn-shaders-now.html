title: Advice - Learn Shaders Now!
---

<p>
   I have one piece of advice for all of you game developers out there: learn shaders
   now!!!! Go out and pick up <a href="http://www.courseptr.com/ptr_detail.cfm?isbn=1-59200-092-4">Sebby's
   book</a> and do it now.
</p>
<p>
   Let's look at some trends in the industry and see if we can't put some clues together
   (with freely available public information) to justify this decision.
</p>
<p>
   1) The fixed function pipeline is emulated in shaders on a lot of newer graphics cards
   (meaning the "true" fixed function pipeline is almost no longer)
</p>
<p>
   2) There is an entire Effects Framework in the SDK to make hooking into Shaders a
   heck of a lot easier and it is actively being developed on.
</p>
<p>
   3) As my <a href="http://www.managed-world.com/SoonDirectXDirect3DNothingElse.aspx">prior
   post shows</a>, Microsoft is definitely NOT afraid of trimming the fat and is starting
   to prove just that.
</p>
<p>
   4) In a&nbsp;good number&nbsp;of newer games, the fixed function pipeline is simply
   used as a "fallback" when some piece of functionality is missing.

   As a game developer, I would want to start learning about shaders now (just like how
   I wouldn't waste the time learning DirectDraw).
