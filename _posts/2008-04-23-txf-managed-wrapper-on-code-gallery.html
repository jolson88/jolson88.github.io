title: TxF Managed Wrapper on Code Gallery
---

<p>Hello, everybody, I have released the first version of a rudimentary managed wrapper around Transactional NTFS to Code Gallery on MSDN: <a title="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/txfmanaged" href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/txfmanaged">http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/txfmanaged</a>. </p>  <p>The wrapper in its current form is very basic but should give developers a good idea on how simple it is to use Transactional NTFS from managed code. Feel free to <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/txfmanaged">go grab it</a>, play around with it (there are some sample screencasts using the wrapper on the Developer Meet Server Show), and feel free to use it any way you wish.</p>  <p>Enjoy!</p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=8418077" width="1" height="1">
