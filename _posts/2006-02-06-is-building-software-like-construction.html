title: Is Building Software Like Construction?
---

<p>
   In an <a href="http://www.managed-world.com/BuildingSoftwareIsNothingLikeConstruction.aspx">earlier
   post</a> of mine, I linked to <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/That-Damned-Construction-Analogy.html">this
   article</a> by Jim Shore on how building software is nothing like construction. This
   is a topic I've been thinking about a&nbsp;fair amount lately and I've come to a conclusion:
   I don't agree entirely with Jim. Here's one of the quotes that have been hanging around
   in my noodle as of late:
</p>
<p>
   <em>"</em>
</p>
<p>
   <em>In the software world, there is no reason for us to follow the practices of an
   industry limited by Newtonian laws. We have no gravity. There is no inertia. Lines
   of code have no weight.</em>
</p>
<p>
   <em>If we want to dig a metaphorical hole after pouring metaphorical concrete, there's
   nothing to stop us. If we want to flip the software upside down and build a foundation
   after we've built the building, we can do it. Our only limits are in are (sic) heads.
   Once we stop thinking that software development is like construction, we'll have one
   less limitation to struggle with.</em>
</p>
<p>
   <em>"</em>
</p>
<p>
   While it is technically true that we, as software developers, are not governed by
   Newtonian laws, I think there is one statement where Jim's hammer misses the nail's
   head: "<em>Our only limits are in are (sic) heads". </em>This is where I disagree. 
</p>
<p>
   It is indeed true that we are not governed by physical, world-bound laws. However,
   that does not mean that we are not governed by any laws whatsoever. This is not a
   logical conclusion. There are most certainly laws that we are bound by depending upon
   the context in which we are developing within. It is just that the laws are software-bound
   instead of physics-bound. Sometimes these laws are relative (like trying to build
   a new Enterprise-level application in .NET and SQL Server at a company whose entire
   infrastructure is built upon Unix and Oracle). I'm sure sometimes there are software
   laws that are absolute as well. The only limits are not in our heads. There are very
   real-world limits that will scope and change a possible solution. To me, that is one
   of the key points behind using the right tool for the right job. If we didn't have
   these constraints, we could use any solution for any problem no matter what the context
   may be (which unfortunately, I have seen done before).
</p>
<p>
   To me, the interesting piece of research would not be&nbsp;researching the fact that
   we are not bound by physical laws. I think the interesting research is finding out
   what laws we are bound by in the virtual world. Who is going to be the Descartes,
   Newton, or Einstein of computer software?
