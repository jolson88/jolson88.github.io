<p>
   Do you want to have a great job where you get paid to have fun? Well, there is a job
   opening on the team I work for here at Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
   So, if you want to work for the greatest team in Developer &amp; Platform Evangelism
   here at Microsoft, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/volkerw/archive/2007/06/20/want-to-be-paid-for-having-fun.aspx">check
   it out</a>. You'll get lots of opportunities to not only drive adoption of Windows
   Server Virtualization in the community, but you get to work directly with the product
   team as well. If that sounds exciting, <a href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=60B4B6EB-9202-48DA-8700-433E140BB7D7">make
   sure to apply</a>.
