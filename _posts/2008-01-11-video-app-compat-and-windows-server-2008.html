<p>As part of the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Developer_Meet_Server">&quot;Developer Meet Server&quot; show</a> on Channel 9, I have started a new series of videos on the topic of application compatibility for Windows Server 2008. I will be releasing one video interview per week all the way until launch, so make sure to keep an eye open!</p>  <p>in <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=370935">this first video</a>, we discuss a bunch of topics in this video that are very pertinent to the topic of Application Compatibility on Windows Server 2008, from Session 0 Isolation to IIS 7 to Mandatory Integrity Control, among many others (I will give any of you five geek points if you can work in &quot;Session 0 Isolation&quot; or &quot;Mandatory Integrity Control&quot; into your next dinner party conversation!).</p>  <p>So, make sure to <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=370935">go check it out</a>.</p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=7078775" width="1" height="1">
