This download was brought to my attention by <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5cfc7b65-16be-409c-b540-a658b3fd058d">Scott</A>. For anyone familiar with UML 2 and disliking working with Visio because of the lack of up-to-date UML stencils, you can download the UML 2 stencils <A href="http://www.phruby.com/stencildownload.html">over here</A>. Enjoy! I know I will :D.<img src ="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/6853.aspx" width = "1" height = "1" />
