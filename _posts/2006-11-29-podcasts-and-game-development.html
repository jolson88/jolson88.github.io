   I don't know why, but apparently it has taken me until now to finally "get" podcasting.
   The interesting part though is that the .NET-type podcasts aren't the ones that have
   really caught my attention. No, it has been the game development and other video game-related
   podcasts that have caught my eye.

   The one that got me started was <a href="http://www.gdcradio.net/">GDC Radio</a>.
   It has a bunch of game development-related podcasts that are excellent. I've loaded
   up on a bunch of them to get ready for my 10 hour flight to Amsterdam on Saturday.
   One particular one that sounds interesting is an interview they did with Bioware on
   '<a href="http://www.gdcradio.net/2006/11/bioware_on_creating_a_monster_1.html">Creating
   a Monster RPG</a>.'
</p>
<p>
   I dug through the iTunes podcast directory (the more I use iTunes, the more I love
   it (that, and my iPod)). That led me to a bunch of podcasts on video games and video
   game reviews. Just what a video game geek like me likes :).

   Now, when I'm packed into the sardine can stuffed with high oxygen levels for exorbitant
   amounts of time this weekend, I can zone out and listen to these podcasts while getting
   all doped up on apocalyptic amounts of caffeine and pretending that I'm on some far-off
   safari voyage across the picturesque lands of the Serengeti (although I don't know
   why I would exactly do that as I'm not much of an outdoor person (I suppose it just
   sounds better than "playing Final Fantasy 3 on my Nintendo DS Lite")).
