title: What we fear the most
---

<p>
   In the past I've had definite self-confidence issues. Heck, I still have self-confidence
   issues that I privately fight with. Recently, I came across something that touched
   a bit close to home and really resonated with me. Funny enough, I actually came across
   this when watching the movie "Akeelah And The Bee" with my wife (which I found to
   be a surprisingly cute movie (despite what "movie critics" might have said (I'll save
   that rant for another time))).
</p>
<p>
   While interviewing at Microsoft, I found myself repeating sections of this to myself
   over and over.&nbsp;It has definitely helped me along when I start to fight self-confidence
   issues. I'd imagine there are others out there that fight with the same kind of mental
   issues. For those of you who do, I would like to share this passage by&nbsp;Nelson
   Mandela and Marriane Williamson:
</p>
<p>
   <strong>What We Fear the Most</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,
</p>
<p>
   Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure,
</p>
<p>
   It is our light not darkness that most frightens us,
</p>
<p>
   We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?
</p>
<p>
   Actually, who are you not to be?
</p>
<p>
   You are a child of God.
</p>
<p>
   Your playing small doesn’t serve the world.
</p>
<p>
   There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure
   around you.
</p>
<p>
   We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
</p>
<p>
   It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone.
</p>
<p>
   And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to
   do the same.
</p>
<p>
   As we are liberated from our own fear; Our presence automatically liberates others.
</p>
