title: Spaceballs - Over-Complication
---

<p>
   After chatting with Chris earlier today, and browsing both the Coding4Fun and UpgradeYourGame
   sites, I have come to the conclusion that I'm over-complicating things here. Like
   Chris, I want to be able to encourage everyone and show that anyone can do this. With
   my last post, I fear I have violated this principle of encouragement. 
</p>
<p>
   This decision isn't only because of others though. I've been fighting with the rotation
   capabilities of SDL.NET today (or rather, the lack of decent ones), and am currently
   quite frustrated. I don't want to fight over this. And with the 40 day deadline approaching,
   I don't necessarily want to fight getting it up to speed and working in Managed DirectX.
   If I've learned anything from work, it is the importance of managing scope.
</p>
<p>
   In the hope of managing scope, I have decided to take a stab to see if GDI+ (like
   the samples on Coding4Fun) will be sufficient for me. I'm assuming that due to the
   fact that the game I'm working on is a simple 2d game, GDI+ should do just the trick
   for me. 
</p>
<p>
   I'm also hoping that by using GDI+, it will help appeal to the hobbyist developers
   out there wanting to "get into" hobbyist game development using the free tools now
   at our disposal. 
</p>
<p>
   Besides, if GDI+ doesn't get in my way too much than I should be able to spend my
   time working on the game mechanics, game features, and the code architecture of the
   entire project. In the future, I can always "upgrade" this to Managed DirectX (maybe
   after XNA Framework has been released).
</p>
<p>
   Back to work.
