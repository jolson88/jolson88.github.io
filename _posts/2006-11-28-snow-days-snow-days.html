Yesterday we saw our first snowfall of the year (at least, sticking-to-the-ground-wise) in the Redmond/Kirkland, WA area. While the Microsoft campus was technically "open" today, all major services (read: shuttles, reception, cafeterias, etc.) were all closed. So, in that sense, I consider the campus "closed" in practice. Since the roads are an absolute mess, I decided staying home today was the best option. <br>
<br>
I went out for some food last night and learned my lesson. While I did get home safely,
it took about 1.5 hours to get 16 city blocks. Not fun, in the least.<br>
<br>
This was also Jasmine's (our doggy) first measurable snow fall as well (at least enough
to play in). And now, the jury is in: Jasmine Loves Snow. I decided I wasn't going
to let this moment slip past me, so I whipped out the camera (which reminded me, I
really need to get a _good_ digital camera).

Here's the view from our back porch this morning (it was a couple inches deep in places):<br>

This time of year is definitely a beautiful one :).<br>
