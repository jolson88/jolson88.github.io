title: Spaceballs - Day 9
---

<p>
   Just a quick update for the night before I head off to bed :).
</p>
<p>
   I finished my move over to a more Model/View/Controller-centric codebase. The move
   was pretty painless. The code is definitely starting to look a lot cleaner. I like
   seeing smaller sized classes that only have a single responsibility :). 
</p>
<p>
   Of course, the MVC pattern does mean more code in general, but the code that is there
   is much more cleaner and easier to maintain if done well. So I'm not so worried about
   that.
</p>
<p>
   The gist of it is that the code is now in a _great_ place for a marathon coding session
   tomorrow of adding enemies, scoring, health, etc. I should be able to plop new enemies
   in relatively easy. Once I get some enemies and scoring in place, then I will look
   at producing a code drop for everyone. 
</p>
<p>
   Like I said, it's a short update :). There will most likely be more to come tomorrow
   :).
