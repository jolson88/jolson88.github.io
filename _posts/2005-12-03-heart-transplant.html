title: Heart Transplant
---

<p>
   Well, it finally happened. After much noise and dismay for several months, the DVD
   drive in my XBox finally gave way. Luckily I had an extra XBox downstairs so I was
   able to transplant the working DVD drive into my main XBox. I guess this means that
   my extra XBox though is simply a box for transplant parts from now on.

   Oh well, at least my XBox is up and running again. Of course, by transplanting the
   DVD drive I did totally bust up the warranty (if it was even under one after what
   I've done to it =P). Well, I'm just happy my XBox is back to good health.
