title: Sonic, America's Drive-In
---

<p>
   How many of you out there have a Sonic near you? This may show my love of food (perhaps
   too much), but I've been seeing a lot of Sonic commercials lately and Unwrapped on
   the Food Network just had a segment on Sonic. I am totally dying to try this place
   out. I just want to know from someone that has tried it if it is any good. Unfortunately,
   the closest one to me is in Idaho I believe (and I'm not THAT obsessed with food).

   I know, I know, a pathetic post to make coming out of my posting coma. What can I
   say? I'm no Rory, that's for sure. It just figures that my first post in a long time
   is about something that has directly contributed to my poor health :P.
