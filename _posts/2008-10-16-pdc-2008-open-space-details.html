I'm here to let you know some of the details of how Open Space will work at PDC and how anybody at PDC can participate.</p> <p>Believe it or not, Open Space is going to be open anytime there are sessions going on at PDC. The first thing you need to know about is how you can participate in the conversation and perhaps even suggest a conversation that you wish to moderate (or just wish to discuss). </p> <p>A description of the process straight from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Wikipedia</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>At the beginning of an Open Space the participants sit in a circle, or in concentric circles for large groups (300 to 2000 people).</em></p> <p><em>The facilitator will greet the people and briefly re-state the theme of their gathering, without giving a lengthy speech. Then someone will invite all participants to identify any issue or opportunity related to the theme. Participants willing to raise a topic will come to the centre of the circle and announce it to the group.</em> </p><p><em></em>  </p><p><em>Someone writes the topics on sheets of papers which get posted on a wall, creating an </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda"><em>agenda</em></a><em>. No participant must suggest issues, but anyone may do so. However, if someone posts a topic, the system expects that the person has a real </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion"><em>passion</em></a><em> for the issue and can lead the discussion on it. No limit exists on the number of issues that the meeting can post.</em> </p><p><em></em>  </p><p><em>When someone determines that the posting of all issues has finished, the meeting sets times and places for the individual sessions; and participants sign up for those individual sessions. Sessions typically last for 1.5 hours. The opening session lasts about an hour, even with a very large group.</em> </p><p><em></em>  </p><p><em>After the opening session, the individual groups go to work. The attendees organize each session; people may freely decide which session they want to attend, and may switch to another one at any time. Online networking can occur both before and following the actual face-to-face meetings so discussions can continue seamlessly.</em></p></blockquote> <p>So, how is this going to work while PDC sessions are going on? Here's what the Open Space schedule looks like: </p><ul> <li><strong>Monday</strong></li> <ul> <li><em>11:00am-12:45pm</em> - Opening Circle - Agenda Creation</li> <li><em>12:45pm-6:30pm</em> - Open Space sessions (aligned with conference session schedule)</li></ul> <li><strong>Tuesday</strong></li> <ul> <li><em>12:30pm-1:45pm</em> - Opening Circle - Agenda Creation</li> <li><em>1:45pm-6:00pm</em> - Open Space sessions (aligned with conference session schedule)</li></ul> <li><strong>Wednesday</strong></li> <ul> <li><em>10:00am-10:30am</em> - Opening Circle - Agenda Creation</li> <li><em>10:30am-5:00pm</em> - Open Space sessions (aligned with conference session schedule)</li></ul> <li><strong>Thursday</strong></li> <ul> <li><em>9:30am-10:15am</em> - Opening Circle - Agenda Creation</li> <li><em>10:15am-1:45pm</em> - Open Space sessions (aligned with conference session schedule)</li> <li><em>1:45pm-3:00pm</em> - Closing Circle</li></ul></ul> <p>So if you are going to be in attendance at PDC 2008, feel free to drop by an participate in Open Space. And if you participate during the week, we highly encourage you to attend the Closing Circle to help close the (Open Space) loop! </p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p> <img src="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/126155.aspx" width="1" height="1" />
