   Hello everyone, and welcome to the second installment of the “Feature Of The Week”
   newsletter. This week, we will take a short little peek at a feature coming in Vista
   and Longhorn Server called Remote Differential Compression. 
<p>
   So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the Longhorn Server Feature Of The Week!

   <b>What is Remote Differential Compression? </b>Remote Differential Compression (RDC)
   allows applications to synchronize data between two computers in an efficient manner.
   The synchronization efficiency is made possible by using compression techniques to
   minimize the amount of data sent across the network. 
<p>
   <b>What makes RDC different from other differencing mechanisms?</b> RDC is different
   from patching-oriented differencing mechanisms, such as Binary Delta Compression (BDC),
   which are designed to operate only on known versions of a single file. RDC makes no
   assumptions about file similarity or versioning. Because differences between files
   are computed on the fly, RDC is ideally suited for synchronizing files that are different
   or have been updated independently. 
<p>
   <b>What scenarios does this enable?</b> RDC is suitable for applications that move
   data across a wide area network where the data transmission costs outweigh the CPU
   cost of signature computation. RDC can also be used on faster networks if the amount
   of data to be transferred is relatively large and the changes to the data are typically
   small.
