From Channel 9, here’s a description of what the Learning Center is: “The Channel 9 Learning Center is the destination for free technical training on emerging Microsoft products and technologies. The Learning Center consists of a set of courses with each course including a set of videos, hands-on labs, and source code samples to get you up-to-speed quickly.”<a href="http://r.ch9.ms/vs2010tw"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="TrainingCourse" border="0" alt="TrainingCourse" align="right" src="http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/jolson/WindowsLiveWriter/VisualStudio2010TrainingCourseonChannel9_8EB6/TrainingCourse_3.jpg" width="335" height="214" /></a></p>  <p>I’m pleased to say that Visual Studio 2010 is one of the first Training Courses that we have launched on Channel 9. Please welcome the <a href="http://r.ch9.ms/vs2010tw">Visual Studio 2010 Training Course</a>.  </p>  <p>What is the Visual Studio 2010 Training Course? The Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4 Training Course includes videos and hands-on-labs designed to help you learn how to utilize the Visual Studio 2010 features and a variety of framework technologies including: C# 4.0, Visual Basic 10, F#, Parallel Computing Platform, WCF, WF, WPF, ASP.NET AJAX 4.0, ASP.NET MVC Dynamic Data. </p>  <p>Essentially, the Training Course is an online version of our Visual Studio 2010 Training Kit. In this first release of the training course, it contains a subset of the content that is actually present in the training kit. Of course, since it is an online delivery mechanism, we will continue to add more items from the training kit into this training course over the coming weeks and months. </p>  <p>This first version of the Training Course includes intro videos and labs on the following technology areas: managed languages, ASP.NET 4, data platform (ADO.NET and “Velocity”), WCF, WF, and Parallel Computing. </p>  <p></p>  <p>I hope you all enjoy the <a href="http://r.ch9.ms/vs2010tw">Visual Studio 2010 Training Course</a> on Channel 9!</p> <img src="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/135638.aspx" width="1" height="1" />
