<P>And the stuff I missed doesn't stop with Halo 2. Over at <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</A> are a bunch of videos with Mr. Wiki himself, Ward Cunningham. It's truly great to hear ideas on these subjects from people like Ward. I feel that anyone *remotely* interested in programming should mosey on over and check those videos out. Here are a couple of links to them:</P>
