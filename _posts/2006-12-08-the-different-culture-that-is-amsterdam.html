title: The different culture that is Amsterdam

<p>
   It's interesting to see how different the culture is in certain ways here in Amsterdam.
   For instance, the difference that everyone talks about: marijuana. There were several
   times where I was sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for someone and I smelt an overwhelming
   smell of smoke, and NOT cigarette smoke. Not only that, but you find Bongs, Hookahs
   (sp?), and various other drug parafenalia at the local corner store. 
</p>

   The impression I get though is that Europeans (at least those here in Holland (the
   small sample that I hung around with)) tend to have a great sense of culture. There
   is definitely a sense of community and history that you get over here (that I haven't
   gotten in the States). 
</p>
<p>
   I know this is going to be a gross generalization, but it always feels like in the
   States you are surrounded by people driving their SUVs to work without a care about
   anyone around them, working all day, and then heading home and not investing back
   into the community in any way. I know I'm certainly guilty of this type of life myself.
   But why? Why am I a hermit? That's something I want to think more about while I'm
   away on this trip.

   One other thing, the public transit system here ROCKS. Other than the charter bus
   I took to the venue a couple of days, I took the train everywhere I went. And it never
   failed, I was always within three stops on a single train when I did go there. And
   it's so efficient. Everytime I tried to catch was either on time, or one to two minutes
   early. I can't imagine this is the way it always is, but it certainly was when I tried
   to take the train. 
</p>

   Seeing how much traffic sucked when I did take the charter bus here, it's no wonder
   why bikes and public transit are so popular here. And with how many people I saw riding
   their bikes or walking, it's no wonder why there were so many people that were not
   obese.

   What a great country. It's so great to get a different perspective on life every once
   in a while.
