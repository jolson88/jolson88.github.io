title: Ahhh, Sweet Vacation
---

<p>
   Well, I get to enjoy a week in a cabin out in the middle of the woods with my wife.
   This is going to be very relaxing. No internet, no work, no phone, no nothing. Of
   course, being the techie that I am (and since it is partly *my* vacation also), I
   can't help but bring some of my guilty pleasures as well (no, I'm not talking about
   my wife (COME ON! It's a joke! I keed, I keed (I'm sorry honey =P))). 
</p>
<p>
   So, what pleasures of mine am I taking that would cause all my coworkers to make fun
   of me (get your mind of the gutter perverts!!)? Well, for one, I'm taking my laptop
   to do some programming on this little RPG diddy I'm messing around with. Two (and
   the one that got most of the razzing from coworkers), I'm taking my LCD monitor and
   an adapter to hook my XBox up to it (yup, I'm taking my XBox).
</p>
<p>
   Chilling out in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with nothing but myself, my wife,
   my laptop, my XBox, and a couple of books. Now THAT'S what I call a vacation. You
   can tease me all I want, but I'm a geek. And I wear the geek badge with honor. I'M
   A GEEK AND I LOVE IT. There, you happy?!?!? 
</p>
<p>
   Plus, since I won't have internet, I won't be able to check any comments to this point
   until I'm back which means there's absolutely NO WAY any of you can spoil this for
   me =P. 
</p>
<p>
   So, I'll see you all here in reality when I get back from my week long vacation FROM
   reality.
</p>
<p>
   See Ya! Wouldn't Want To Be Ya! I'm out!
