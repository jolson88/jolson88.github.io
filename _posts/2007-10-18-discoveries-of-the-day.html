title: Discoveries of the day
---

<p>
   Well, another day, more work done, more lessons learned, and some new and exciting
   discoveries and announcements made as well.
</p>
<p>
   First of all, Soma <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx">announced
   on his blog today</a> that F# is becoming an "official" .NET language, joining the
   ranks of languages like C#, VB, C++/CLI, JScript, IronRuby, IronPython, etc. If you're
   not familiar, F# is a functional language that started out in Microsoft Research as
   a project of Don Syme's. I think this is great news. And I'm thinking that perhaps
   I should give F# a try before I try Haskell or Erlang. 
</p>

   The other discovery of the day was the XSI ModTool from SoftImage, a free modeling
   tool that also has XNA integration. It sounds and looks like a pretty comprehensive
   tool (especially for "free") and I am excited to give this a try. You can find more
   information on XSI ModTool here: <a title="http://www.softimage.com/products/modtool/" href="http://www.softimage.com/products/modtool/">http://www.softimage.com/products/modtool/</a>.
   Enjoy!

   Other than that, just more work. Working on some presentations for the upcoming trip
   to Tech Ed Developer in Barcelona, Spain, continuing to work on Transactional NTFS,
   programming other Windows Server 2008 enhancements like Wait Chain Traversal, etc.
   I'm also back to spending time doing game development with XNA. I spent quite a bit
   of time with Torque X which I'll talk about here and on Xna3Way in the coming week
   or so. 
</p>
<p>
   Fun, fun, fun :). Now back to work (so I can hurry up and get stuff done in order
   to spend time with the wife and son today (oh, my son, there's another post I have
   to make, he's SUCH a joy!)).
