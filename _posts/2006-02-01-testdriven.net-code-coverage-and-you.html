title: TestDriven.NET, Code Coverage and YOU
---

I just came across <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c0a023b1-195d-4441-9f43-336d083f8dcc">this
post</a> of Hanselman's lately. It appears that Jamie Cansdale added some more functionality
to TestDriven.NET. Now you can actually run your tests within Visual Studio with Test
Coverage results directly from TDD.NET. Pretty darn cool I must say. I think it's
time to plug this stuff in at work :).<img width="0" height="0" src="http://www.managed-world.com/aggbug.ashx?id=7b06dca6-74c5-4133-921d-3f7e256a54ab">
