title: Now I remember why I love XNA so much
---

<p>
   I had a fresh reminder of the exact reason why I love XNA so much. I figured that
   I wanted to brush up on my "1337 5k!llz" and that it was about time to get back into
   C++ stuff. Well, I love game development, so why not brush up by developing a game,
   right? Well, that was my thinking behind this whole story.
</p>
<p>
   I've been a DirectX kind of guy ever since I started in game development. So, what
   the heck, I figured I would stir up the pot and try some OpenGL development in C++.
   Not a problem, there's a metric crap-ton of OpenGL tutorials over on <a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/">NeHe</a> that
   I can follow. Here I come "Creating a Window", YEE HAW! Visual C++ Express installed?
   CHECK. Windows SDK installed? CHECK. Visual C++ Settings pointing to new Windows SDK
   directories? CHECK. I'm ready to roll, all y'all. Let's get on with it homeboys.
</p>
<p>
   So, open up the first tutorial, type in all the code for creating a window and clearing
   the screen....
</p>
<p>
   ....
</p>
<p>
   DAMN, that was a LOT of typing. Holy moley, I could have developed a bad case of arthritis
   from the tutorial alone. Geez, how many lines of code is this? 400?!?!?!?!?!? 400
   lines of code to get a BLANK WINDOW on the screen? WTF?!?!? Okay, forget getting my
   "1337 5k!llz" back in shape, I'm just going to spend that time continuing to work
   with XNA. 
</p>
<p>
   Perhaps to make it more "1337," I'll play around with the Lex/Yacc-type stuff in the
   Visual Studio SDK to write my own language that I can use as a custom scripting language
   in a game. Yummy.

   TIMMMMMEH!!! TIMMMMMEH!!!
