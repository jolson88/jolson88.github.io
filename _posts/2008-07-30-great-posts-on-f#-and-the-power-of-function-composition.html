They are actually by Dustin Campbell on <a href="http://diditwith.net">his blog</a>: <a href="http://diditwith.net/CategoryView,category,Project%2BEuler.aspx">http://diditwith.net/CategoryView,category,Project%2BEuler.aspx</a>.  </p><p>  </p><p>I think these posts are some of the best F# posts I have seen out there so far. I love them because they show off the real beauty and power of F#, and don't do the whole “here’s how F# can behave like other languages” treatment that I’ve seen in so many other places.  </p><p>  </p><p>Those posts (and <a href="http://diditwith.net/CategoryView,category,F%23.aspx">any other F# posts</a> on Dustin’s blog) are a MUST READ if you are at all interested in F# or functional programming. </p> <img src="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/126157.aspx" width="1" height="1" />
