tags: [Training]
---

<p>I have posted <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=374129">a new video</a> to the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Developer_Meet_Server">Developer Meet Server Show</a> on Channel 9. This video discusses common MSI Installer Issues you might run into if deploying an application onto Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008. From the description of the video:</p>  <p><em>&quot;In this video, we chat with Robert Flaming about application compatibility issues around Windows Installer for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Mark Taylor, from our first Application Compatibility video, sits in as well to fire off some important questions (well, questions that are perhaps more educated than I would ask).&quot;</em></p>  <p>Enjoy!</p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=7152326" width="1" height="1">
