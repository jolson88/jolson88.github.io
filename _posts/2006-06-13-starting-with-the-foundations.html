title: Starting with the Foundations
---

<p>
   I was asked recently what excited me most about the various Vista technologies. While
   I took a valiant stab at limiting my answer down to a handful of them, the proper
   answer with the way I feel would have been "what _doesn't_ excite me about the various
   Vista technologies." Yes, I could get into the various aspects that excite me about
   Workflow Foundation, Presentation Foundation, and/or Communication Foundation. I will
   save that for a later blog post though. Save to say, I'm extremely stoked right now
   about doing some development with all the different Foundation technologies. I think
   I'm going to do some deep-diving into Workflow Foundation for a while though :).

   So, after a hiatus for almost a year (has it really been that long?), I will be spending
   time again getting into the various Vista technologies that are coming our way. So
   stay tuned in the future for more Vista updates :).
