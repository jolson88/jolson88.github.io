A while ago, I was able to start playing around with a programming language called SmallBasic being developed internally at Microsoft by Vijaye Raji. And now, it's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/cc950524.aspx">finally been announced</a> as part of our new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/10/23/inspiring-through-innovation-devlabs.aspx">Dev Labs effort</a>. </p> <p>So what is SmallBasic? From the website:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"Small Basic is a project that's aimed at bringing "fun" back to programming. By providing a small and easy to learn programming language in a friendly and inviting development environment, Small Basic makes programming a breeze. Ideal for kids and adults alike, Small Basic helps beginners take the first step into the wonderful world of programming."</em></p></blockquote> <p>Why develop SmallBasic? Well, I can tell you the reason that I'm excited about it. I personally feel that in the absence of QBASIC, GWBASIC, etc., there is no longer a programming language that is easy for non-programmers to get hooked with. All our modern .NET languages currently are more "professional" languages. But what is out there for 6-10 year olds (for example) to play around with easily in order to "get the bug" of programming. Nothing from Microsoft, if you ask me.  </p><p>Â  </p><p>This is why I'm so ecstatic that SmallBasic is finally available publically (keep in mind, it's not an official product, simply DevLabs bits that you can play around with). So, even if you are a professional programmer, feel free to go over, <a href="us/devlabs/cc950524.aspx">download it</a>, and play around for a bit.</p> <p>One of my favorite things? For one, the editor. It's a pretty clever take on Intellisense and the editor is a great example of a "friendly" IDE.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <img src="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/126154.aspx" width="1" height="1" />
