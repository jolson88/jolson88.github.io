title: Microsoft Robotics Studio, Holy Cow
---

<p>
   Holy Moly! Could Microsoft release fewer cool products for a while please? :). There
   has been so many exciting technologies coming out lately that it seems like there
   is hardly enough time to investigate them all. The latest edition to this group of
   great technologies? <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/">Microsoft Robotics
   Studio</a>.
</p>
<p>
   There are a few things that excite me about this specific technology (from what limited
   investigation I have done on it during my lunch break today):
</p>
<p>
   1) It is enabled for both Visual Studio _and_ the Express products (you can even use
   it from IronPython).
</p>
<p>
   2) Robotic simulation. If you don't have the hardware to play around with it, Microsoft
   Robotics Studio includes robot simulation using DirectX that you can use to&nbsp;programatically
   build a robot and&nbsp;show how your "software" would work with the robot. I'm slightly
   jealous because this was one of the ideas I had behind my next game (take this Studio
   and make a "battle game" around it, and that was Tanks). 
</p>
<p>
   So, I&nbsp;obviously need to play around with this some more. Perhaps I'll still build
   Tanks now that a good amount of the "leg work" has been done for me through Microsoft
   Robotics Studio. I'm wondering since&nbsp;Robotics Studio&nbsp;has its own runtime
   and such,&nbsp;if I can embed that runtime within a game so that I can build a game
   around it. Heck, that sounds like a fun project as a&nbsp;matter of fact.&nbsp;Perhaps
   I've found&nbsp;my next endeavor after Spaceballs is finished.
</p>
<p>
   Enjoy!&nbsp;
