title: Spaceballs - Day 2
---

<p>
   Seeing that George is so willing to be open about his plans and progress, I've decided
   to follow you suit. After all, this should make it more enjoyable for you readers
   out there (is there anybody out there?). So, on to a progress report, shall we?
</p>
<p>
   In order to help manage the scope of this project due to the time frame, I have decided
   that Spaceballs will be a 2d game instead of 3d. This should simplify many aspects
   of the coding by minimizing the sheer amount of code that needs to be written. The
   other thing that I am doing to help manage the scope is that I'm not writing my own
   "engine" code from scratch. That's right, you won't see a lick of Managed DirectX
   or OpenGL code out there (which some of you may find shocking).
</p>
<p>
   So, if no Managed DirectX or OpenGL, what am I using? I'm actually using the <a href="http://cs-sdl.sourceforge.net/index.php/Main_Page">.NET
   wrapper for SDL</a>. Since I won't have to write much graphics or input code, I should
   be able to spend more time focusing on the game features and game play. 
</p>
<p>
   In the vein of controlling scope (aka preventing scope creep), there are several features
   that I was getting around to implementing in Tanks that I have decided to axe in Spaceballs.
   Mainly, I will not be writing a virtual in-game Console, and I won't be doing saved
   games or game replays. 
</p>
<p>
   To help me get from start to finish sooner, I have decided to adopt the "Tracer Bullet"
   paradigm from The Pragmatic Programmer. I will get my game fully functional through
   and through (with very few features) and then I will improve on that over time. As
   of tonight, I have actually made progress in this regard.
</p>
<p>
   Where do I stand tonight? I have my MessageProcessor (the "nervous system" of the
   game) completed and hooked up. I have also created my GraphicsService and StateService
   classes and completed the ServiceLocator that will be able to lookup and retrieve
   these services at runtime. I will go into this pattern in a future post and explain
   how it will also make unit testing the game quite easy (well, at least easier than
   what it would be using other means). 
</p>
<p>
   I also have all my main game states (MenuState/PlayState/RecapState/HighScoreState)
   hooked up to the StateService. Not only that, but I have the keyboard handling working
   and pumping into the StateService. Currently, you can use keys to navigate through
   every state of the game. The "instructions" for how to navigate&nbsp;are printed on
   each state and state transitions are handled when the correct keys are pressed. I'm
   thinking that this weekend I'll probably add a ShipSelectionState and DirectionsState. 
</p>
<p>
   Sooooooo, to make a long story short, I have my "framework" set up and a good start
   to a tracer bullet working. Everything is also logging as expected by using log4net.
</p>
<p>
   Sometime this weekend I will try to make a longer post on the patterns I am using
   to establish the architecture of my game code. If done properly, this should definitely
   easy the development process while cranking this game out the door. Until then, I'll
   see you all next time :).
</p>
<p>
   P.S. I now officially have this coming Monday-Wednesday off of work (PTO), so expect
   me to make a serious push to getting this sucker playable :P.
