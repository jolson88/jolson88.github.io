<p>
   You know, when I read <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/clingermangw/archive/2006/09/26/92350.aspx">George's
   opinion last week</a>, I was still skeptical. But I figured that I would tune in and
   watch it tonight. Oh... My... Goodness!!!! George was right, this show kicks total
   buttay. I just can't get enough of it. After an hour, I was pissed that it was over
   and I have to wait another week (ANOTHER WEEK!) to see the next one.

<p>
   please, Please, PLEASE let the network not cancel this show. This is one of the best
   TV shows I've seen in a while (although now I don't know whether I like this or Eureka
   better). Man, between Eureka and Heroes, I'm in TV heaven right now.
