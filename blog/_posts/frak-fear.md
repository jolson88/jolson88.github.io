# F**k Fear
TODO (a post about letting fear dominate your career; something I suffer from a lot).

> "But there is no reason to live and no limit to our miseries if we let our fears predominate" - Seneca, Moral Letters, 13.12b

> "Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance" - Franklin Delano Roosevelt

TODO (inspired by The Daily Stoic, September 9th).
