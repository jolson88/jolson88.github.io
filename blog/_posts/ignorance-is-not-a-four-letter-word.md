**Ignorance is Not a Four-Letter Word**
*The importance of a growth mindset, taking risks, and making mistakes. And how the lack of this mindset has contributed to many problems in the software development industry today.*

>>> "Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning." - [Carol Dweck](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)

I was originally exposed to the concept of a Growth Mindset when reading the book "[Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](http://amzn.to/2gR13kc)" by Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D. It came recommended to me by a former manager of mine. I quickly recognized that I suffered from a Fixed Mindset and started to realize all the ways it impacted my life, especially my career as a software developer.

Lately though, I've been thinking through this idea in more depth and I have come to the opinion that this behavior of "worshipping at the altar of Talent" contributes to so many of the limiting behaviors we are facing in our software development culture today. These behaviors tend to give people very bad experiences and ultimately disrupt our ability to connect with each other in constructive and healthy ways.

# Community: The Cult of Personality (a.k.a. Worshipping Talent and Expertise)
I most definitely fall victim to this... routinely. My personal development heroes are the Alan Kays, the Rich Hickeys, the Joe Armstrongs, the Erik Meijers, etc. I find myself thinking "I'll never be as smart as them, if only I had as much talent and intellect as they do." It's not that they don't offer huge swaths of knowledge you can learn from. It's that I tend to tear myself down in admiring their knowledge.

But we also see the impact of Worshipping Talent exhibit itself in much more insidious ways, especially at technical conferences or in blog post comments. It's extremely easy to fall back on looking down at lesser-experienced developers sharing the discoveries they have made in their own development journey. Perhaps you've been siting in the audience at a talk and silently wondered why *they* are the ones giving a presentation? After all, "we want to hear from the folks that are smarter than us, that have more talent than us, the ones that we feel we can look up to".

It's hard to have an open mind and be willing to learn from somebody if we feel like they know less than us or somehow have less talent than we do. You can even find many talks and presentations out there where people in the audience feel like they need to correct the presenter or prove they know more and that their opinion is correct.

# Community: Ignorance is Not Bliss (a.k.a The Desire To Look Smart / The Fear of Looking Dumb)
Going hand-in-hand with the above, there is a lot of peer pressure to look smart in this industry. We want the respect of our peers. We don't want to admit we don't know something and then look dumb in the process. Some communities even self-identify as "the smart kids" or others talk-down to "the more simple-minded folk." This behavior only serves to perpetuate a fixed mindset.

# Community: Judgying By Behavior (a.k.a. Aggressive Criticism of Others)
Building on the theme again, thinking with a fixed mindset contributes to our insecurities having built-in defense mechanisms that serve to tear down others and their ideas. TODO
	- Aggressive criticism of other teams, solutions, etc. (Judging By Behavior)
		- "We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behaviour." - Stephen Covey
		- Invalidation or criticism of other people's ideas (e.g. because "your idea" is better)

	- Pointing-Blame. Not wanting to be "the one at fault", so blaming others for failures.

But the impact of viewing ignorance as bad not only impacts our larger software industry, it can also impact us all individually in ways we may not even realize. 

# Self-Limiting: Mistakes Are Bad
As an inventor, Edison made 1,000 unsuccessful attempts at inventing the light bulb. When a reporter asked, "How did it feel to fail 1,000 times?" Edison replied, "**I didn’t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.**" Henry Ford, R. H. Macy, and many other business pioneers failed many times before they succeeded. But somehow we end up at the belief that Mistakes Are Bad.

We might feel compelled to cover up our mistakes. We may not want the people we respect and admire to see our mistakes. "What will people think?" "Maybe the company will realize I can't actually do this job and they'll finally fire me." 

[Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is "a concept describing individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a 'fraud'." I'll admit it right now, I often suffer from imposter syndrome. So do many other developers I know. Making mistakes can form a feedback loop, enhancing our imposter syndrome in the process. But why?

I think at the end of the day, we view making mistakes as bad because we fail to realize that making mistakes is a great way to learn. We associate making mistakes with a lack of talent. Perhaps we think "if only I were smarter, I wouldn't be making these mistakes."

It's extremely difficult to get over this self-bias. But when living with a Growth Mindset, we start to realize that each mistake we make is an opportunity to learn. And that's A Good Thing.

>>> "I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed" - Michael Jordan

# Self-Limiting: Lack of Sharing
	- Lack of blogging and sharing of experiences
		- "Rocket scientist Robert Goddard found his ideas bitterly rejected by his scientific peers on the grounds that rocket propulsion would not work in the rarefied atmosphere of outer space"

Now that's a lot of crappy and no-fun stuff to stem from an over-arching fear of ignorance, or approaching ignorance as A Bad Thing. But it doesn't only impact us individually or as a community, it also directly impacts the companies we work at.

# Company: Being Risk-Averse
>>> "Organizations that embody a growth mindset encourage appropriate risk-taking, knowing that some risks won’t work out. They reward employees for important and useful lessons learned, even if a project does not meet its original goals. They support collaboration across organizational boundaries rather than competition among employees or units." - [Carol Dweck](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)

TODO (the fear of doing what's right because of the fear of breaking something; employees not feeling empowered to make changes).

At a fixed mindset company, we can also find ourselves being less willing to engage with team members. In one way being will to admit when you don't know something is also a form of risk tasking. But do we work at a company that actively encourages us to take that risk? Or do we suffer negative consequences from that action (e.g. fewer opportunities for growth due lack of perceived skill, team members having less confidence in our abilities after, lower performance reviews because we aren't viewed as "strong/smart", etc.)?

# Company: Viewing Downtime As Horrendous
	- Downtime/Problems Viewed As Bad (instead of opportunities for learning and growth)
		- Downtime is viewed as bad, instead of opportuntieis for learning and growth. It is through learning and growth that systems improve and evolve over time. The best way to make a more robust and reliable system is to be willing to find the ways the system breaks in the first place, having the conversation about how to fix it, and then fixing it. Without this, the system itself remains incredibly brittle and doesn't improve. 

# Company: More Rigid Development Processes
	- More rigid development process. (as mistakes are viewed as bad, more process ends up getting added to try to prevent mistakes from happening in the first place; over time, this negatively impacts the ability to deliver software and to make the evolutionary and revolutionary changes that are needed for a business organization to thrive).

# Company: Emphasis on Talent and Hiring Talent
>>> "A company that plays the talent game makes it harder for people to practice growth-mindset thinking and behavior, such as sharing information, collaborating, innovating, seeking feedback, or admitting errors." - [Carol Dweck](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)

This is an area that I know I tend to fall back into a fixed mindset. It's an area that I can improve on. TODO (seeking out the talent, seeing other people's talent vs. emphasis on learning opportunities and growth).

# In Closing
So what can we do about all of this? First off, we need to be willing to take appropriate risks. We need to recognize that making mistakes provides opportunities to learn. We need to stop being hard on ourselves when we make mistakes. And perhaps more importantly, we need to stop being hard on others when they make mistakes. Every mistake is a learning oppoortunity. You can not only learn from your own mistakes, but you can learn from others mistake. Mistakes Are Good. They are a sign that you are stretching your abilities and growing.

We also need to stop defining our own self-worth by the set of knowledge we have today or how much talent we think we do or don't have. By being willing to admit when we don't know a topic, we can learn from others. We need to recognize that every moment of not knowing can be a moment for learning. But we can't do this if we're not willing to admit what we don't know.

I often tell team members or people I'm mentoring that I'll be the first one to admit that I'm ignorant on a topic. I'll even do it during meetings in order to better understand the other person's viewpoints. Ignorance is not a four-letter word. We need to let ourselves and our team members make mistakes. We need to be supportive of people willing to put themselves out there and share what they've learned, no matter what phase of growth they are in.

We need to recognize that talents can be developed, that they come from hard work and learning. We should not take away the avenues we have for making mistakes. We should not take away the avenues we have for learning from others. This will only inhibit growth in the long-run. We need to start living with a Growth Mindset and showing in actions what that means.
