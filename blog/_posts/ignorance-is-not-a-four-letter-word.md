IGNORANCE IS NOT A FOUR LETTER WORD (the importance of a growth mindset and taking risks)

TODO (Growth Mindset)

TODO (Impact on Software Development Culture)
	- Worship of Expertise (Cult of Personality)
	- Aggressive criticism of other teams, solutions, etc. (Judging By Behavior)
		- "We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behaviour." - Stephen Covey
		- Invalidation or criticism of other people's ideas (e.g. because "your idea" is better)
	- Wanting to look "smart" (corallary: not wanting to look dumb) (e.g. Ignore is Not Bliss)
		- Imposter Syndrome (this is a major source). When you define your value and the value you contribute as a function of the knowledge you have today, you feel like an imposter because you don't know nearly as much as those you look up and think there is no way you will have the impact they do on the world.

TODO (Consequences in individual actions)
	- Mistakes Are Bad. Not being willing to make mistakes and learn from them.
		- Edison Story: As an inventor, Edison made 1,000 unsuccessful attempts at inventing the light bulb. When a reporter asked, "How did it feel to fail 1,000 times?" Edison replied, "I didnâ€™t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps."
		- Henry Ford, R. H. Macy, and other business pioneers failed many times before they exceeded.
		- "I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed" - Michael Jordan
	- Pointing-Blame. Not wanting to be "the one at fault", so blaming others for failures.
	- Lack of blogging and sharing of experiences
		- "Rocket scientist Robert Goddard found his ideas bitterly rejected by his scientific peers on the grounds that rocket propulsion would not work in the rarefied atmosphere of outer space"

TODO (Consequences of Fixed Mindset in Developer Organizations)
	- Less engagement with team members
	- More rigid development process. (as mistakes are viewed as bad, more process ends up getting added to try to prevent mistakes from happening in the first place; over time, this negatively impacts the ability to deliver software and to make the evolutionary and revolutionary changes that are needed for a business organization to thrive).
	- Downtime/Problems Viewed As Bad (instead of opportunities for learning and growth)
	- Slower learning process and being risk-averse (no wanting mistakes to happen)
		- Downtime is viewed as bad, instead of opportuntieis for learning and growth. It is through learning and growth that systems improve and evolve over time. The best way to make a more robust and reliable system is to be willing to find the ways the system breaks in the first place, having the conversation about how to fix it, and then fixing it. Without this, the system itself remains incredibly brittle and doesn't improve. 

TODO (What can we do about it?)
