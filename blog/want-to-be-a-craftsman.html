    Developers have long discussed and debated whether programming is an art, a science, an engineering practice, or 
    something else. I don’t believe in Blacks and Whites. I think programming means different things to different people.
    And programming fulfills different expectations depending on its use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the last ten years, I’ve taken quite the winding road as a developer. Before joining Microsoft, I was a back-end
    server developer using C#. I loved writing code. I loved learning how to write better code. I loved reading well written
    code. I loved Design Patterns, and Enterprise Application Architecture, and Test-Driven Development, and all the fancy
    buzzwords at the time. I blogged about these loves. I gave talks about these loves. Then several years later, I got a call that
    started the next phase of my career.
  </p>
  <p>
    Almost on a whim, I joined Microsoft after a recruiter contacted me about an open position. It was like being called up to
    the Big Leagues for me, finally called home to the Mothership. I joined Microsoft as a Technical Evangelist. I blogged and
    shared other people’s technologies. I was talking about the problems other people were having. I later joined Windows as a
    Program Manager. I worked to deliver technologies like the Windows Runtime and cool new video editing APIs. But over time,
    I just found myself less excited. I was at Microsoft for over nine years. Towards the end, I knew it was time for me to
    move on.
  </p>
  <p>
    I felt like I was rapidly losing touch with the development world I once held so dear. I saw many of the cool technologies
    my friends were working with and I found myself wanting to be in their shoes. i had lost my passion. I had lost my fire.
    That feeling of excitement about going to work in the morning? I missed that feeling.
  </p>
</section>
<h2>Getting back to my roots</h2>
<section>
  <p>
    So I started interviewing at different companies. I found a couple that I was extremely excited about and absolutely loved
    the technologies they were using. Through the interview process, I fell in love with my current company and team at Concur.
    They have a great culture, a great group of individuals, and a great set of technologies that are sharpening my tools again
    (and hey, we’re hiring!). I had thought about interviewing at Concur ever since Howard Dierking started talking about the
    work he was doing here. However, I let fear prevent me from taking the leap. “I don’t want to be rejected”. “I’m comfortable
    here at Microsoft”. “I couldn’t possibly find a job as good as this”. “I should be happy here, I’m lucky”. All the usual
    suspects. I finally did take the leap though, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do I regret my time at Microsoft? Not at all. I enjoyed most of my time there. I worked with many great people (too many
    people to list here). I learned a lot from the many managers and coworkers I had over the years. I had many great
    experiences like talking at the //build conference and seeing how large-scale software is made and shipped. Now that I’m
    getting my dev legs back under me, I feel like everything I learned during my time at Microsoft has made me a better
    developer. Being a Program Manager taught me to think critically about technology and to focus on the things that actually
    provide value. The many different projects gave me a well-rounded software education which I will always be thankful for.
  </p>

<h2>Being A Craftsman</h2>
<section>
  <p>
    Here’s the thing though… I want to be a Craftsman. I need to be creating. I need to be getting my hands
    dirty. I’m inspired by documentaries like <a href="https://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi/">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7708E1bmoxc">Building Without Nails</a>,
    <a href="https://designisonefilm.com/">Design Is One</a>,
    and Helvetica. I’m inspired by developers that use Vim or Emacs and can craft their own customized development
    environment; I love Tim Ewald’s talk on Clojure: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShEez0JkOFw">Programming with Hand Tools.</a>
    I love “craftsman” programming languages like LISP/Scheme, Clojure, Smalltalk, Self, etc. The things people do with
    creative coding frameworks like Processing, or Cinder, or Open Frameworks absolute amaze me. <a href="https://gmunk.com/">gmunk’s</a>
    work on the interfaces in the movie Oblivion? Jaw-dropping (bonus: I discovered he did the graphics for my favorite
    desktop wallpaper in Windows 10!).
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to touch other people’s lives. I want to share my love for writing code again. I want to be a Code
    Craftsman other people look up to. For others that want to be hackers, or engineers, or scientists, that’s cool.
    But it’s not me.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing is for sure: it’s <em>great</em> to be back! It’s great to have started the next phase of my career.
    And I can’t wait to see the stuff I’ll be a part of in the years to come.
