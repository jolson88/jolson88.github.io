    The other day on Twitter, some friends and I were discussing the narrative books we like that are
    about technology (not technical books themselves). These are books about notable figures in the
    technology field, about the history of a specific technology, and so on. Here is my list of books that
    I consider must-reads for those techies out there that like this type of stuff (in no particular order).
  </p>
  <p>
    If one of your favorite books is not on this list, please leave a comment as I would love to have
    more books to add to my list!

  <h2>Jason's Must-Read</h2>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xKtFTM">
      iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is perhaps one of my most favorite books on a notable figure in the technology field.
    Though I'm not personally a hardware guy, it's hard to find somebody to look up to more than
    Steve Wozniak. He is most definitely a Mozart of hardware design. I usually find the last part
    of the book (when it's less technical) less interesting, but don't let that deter you from a
    great book!
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xK9MMM">
      Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is a book all about Linus Torvalds and the creation of Linux. I think it's best when it's
    being very technical. Then again, I'm a geek üòÄ. This book gives interesting insight into the
    motivations and life of Linus.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2wBTIg2">
      The Second Coming of Steve Jobs.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    It's amazing the difference a single person can make in the direction and drive of a large
    company. I personally think it is one of the reasons Apple is who they are. There is no doubt
    that Steve Jobs was a major influence and he probably single-handedly saved the company when
    he returned.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gzvqvB">
      Showstopper! The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Ah, the creation of Windows NT. Quite the milestone for Microsoft. This book gives good insights
    into the culture of the Windows division at the time and the many different conflicts that were
    happening that impacted the development of Windows NT. If you're a "Microsoft Guy" (as in, you
    know of executives like Soma, Bob Muglia, and the like), you will find yourself recognizing many
    names within this book. At the heart of it is Dave Cutler. There are many times where you'll
    either laugh or be incredibly scared at some of the behavior by Dave Cutler as he pushed his team
    to ship Windows NT.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x6fKuc">
      Microserfs.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Let's say one thing, this book is not based on a true story. However, it might as well be.
    It probably shouldn't be on this list as it is a fictional book. Oh well! From what I've heard,
    it captures much of the feeling and culture of what it was like to work at Microsoft in the late
    1980s and early 1990s. Even before working at Microsoft, I enjoyed this book very much. However,
    after working at Microsoft, I really like this book üòÄ. It's fun to get some of the inside jokes
    after knowing Microsoft from the inside (like the main character working in Building 7 which
    doesn't exist and is a part of Microsoft lore). If you're familiar with the areas of Redmond and
    Bellevue that surround Microsoft's main campus, you'll smile several times during this book.
    The book isn't entirely based at Microsoft as many of the characters move on to different
    things.
    <em>
      Interestingly enough, I have a version of this book as a ‚ÄúBook on Tape‚Äù that is
      narrated by Matthew Perry.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x62TbH">
      The Soul of a New Machine.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This book tells the story of the one-year development of a 32-bit minicomputer built by Data
    General engineers in the 1970s. It's a crazy time shown in this book and a fun read. This book
    was a page-turner for me. I'm glad I don't work on a team like this in real life though. It was
    definitely quite the time to be involved in the computer industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gzFzbk">
      Coders at Work.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    A masterful set of interviews done with well-known subjects from all over the computer field. In
    this book, you will find interviews ranging from Guy Steel (father of Scheme/Lisp), to Donald
    Knuth, to Simon Peyton Jones (of Haskell fame), and many others. This book is very suited to
    sudden starts and stops so I found myself reading it before bed and when I had quick breaks
    during the day. Though I skipped around a bunch, I found myself with a compulsive need to read
    every single interview in the book (and it's hard to find an interview in the book less than 40
    pages long). A must read, especially for programmers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2vG1oAv">
      Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is most definitely not a narrative. It's actually a borderline encyclopedia on the making of
    the personal computer. You don't sit down and read this book through in one sitting (it's massive
    to-boot). But it's still fun to have this one on the shelf to go through from time to time to get
    a fairly complete breakdown on all the events (and their timelines) that led to the development
    of the personal computer (and how it evolved).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2w06q6p">
      Dreaming in Code: Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years, 4,732 Bugs, and One Quest for Transcendent Software.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    If you like The Soul Of A New Machine, you should like this book as well (and vice versa). This
    book is largely considered a ‚Äúmodern retelling‚Äù of Soul Of A New Machine by many people. Having
    read both books, I can't exactly disagree with that sentiment. Provides much of the same context
    and insight into the computer field for a more modern age that Soul Of A New Machine did for the
    1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2wBJ0pW">
      Smalltalk-80: The Language and its Implementation.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Alan Kay is one of my tech heroes as I have mentioned in the past. I love many of the concepts
    that come from Smalltalk-80. As a developer who writes object-oriented code from time to time,
    it's a fascinating insight into the language whose inventor coined the term "object-oriented
    programming" in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/">
      The Early History of Smalltalk (free PDF available).
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Yes, this is not a book. This is actually a paper written by Alan Kay. This means you can't get any more
    accurate about all the events leading up to the birth of Smalltalk, considering it was written by the
    visionary behind Smalltalk. In this paper, Alan goes back all the way to his college days and talks
    about many of the cutting edge research being done in the computer field that gave the inspiration
    that ultimately led to the development of Smalltalk. I can't express enough how much I believe this
    to be a must-read for any language fan/geek. Do it now, there is no excuse to download the PDF as you
    are reading this!
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2vZLsnX">
      Masterminds of Programming: Conversations with the Creators of Major Programming Languages.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    If you don't know already, I'm a language geek. I'm fascinated by the design and implementation of
    programming languages. With that in mind, there should be no surprise on why I like this book so much.
    This book, as the title says, contains a bunch of interviews with many different implementers of
    major programming languages. If you're a language geek like myself, this book is a Must Read.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2wBvToD">
      The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Heard of Turing Machines? Perhaps you're not a mathematician? If so, this is a fantastic read. In this
    book, Charles Petzold provides the background knowledge and context that is required to understand Alan
    Turing's groundbreaking paper. Charles Petzold walks you through the paper practically
    sentence-for-sentence, breaking down what it means and the ramifications for each section. This book
    can border on ‚Äúbrain explosion‚Äù from time to time, but is well worth the effort to read it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gzNHsz">
      Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I'm fascinated by how things work, and this book walks you all the way from logical gates (AND, OR,
    XOR, etc.) to how memory works all the way down to the logical gate level. It then builds on this to
    show the guts of how CPUs work. You'll find yourself starting with basics like light bulbs and switches,
    and ending with the basics of computers. Another ‚Äúgold-star‚Äù to Charles Petzold for this book. Get it!
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2eytOkQ">
      In Code: A Mathematical Journey.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I'm not a mathematician. In fact, compared to other software developers I know, my math skills and
    knowledge is pretty poor. Yet I continue to find myself intrigued by topics like Cryptography. If that
    sounds like you, this book is a must-have. It chronicles the journey of a young woman through the land
    of mathematics and into the realm of cryptography. It is amazing what this young woman accomplishes at
    her age. This book tells the narrative in such a way that you get to understand how it works as well
    as she walks along her learning path. And we're not talking about ‚ÄúCryptography 101‚Äù either.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xJVSu5">
      Revolution In The Valley.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is about how the Mac was made and is written by one of the main engineers of the Mac as well (Andy
    Hertzfeld). It is filled with fun stories behind the creation of the Mac and the personalities on the team.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2vFRQFy">
      The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I love classic cryptography, its history, and how it applies to our modern computers today. This is a
    fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable read through the history of cryptography.

  <h2>Jason's Must-Watch</h2>
  <p>
    The following ones are technically "must-watch" as they are videos, not books. But I find myself popping
    them in when I'm in one of those moods (and want some video playing in the background while I code).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5nEnA">
      Pirates of Silicon Valley.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is a made-for-TV movie based on the book Fire In The Valley from above. It mostly focuses on the
    early days of Apple and Microsoft and the interaction between the two. Not 100% accurate, but still fun
    to watch.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xJRdIx">
      Triumph of the Nerds.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    An early (pre-Windows 95 launch) three-part documentary done by Robert X. Cringley. Has some interesting
    interviews with Steve Ballmer, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, and more. Discusses some of the
    conflicts between IBM and Microsoft towards the end of that partnership as well as diving back into some
    of the early history of the Altair and Apple 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gztClZ">
      Revolution OS.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    A documentary about the creation and initial rise of Linux. Has interviews with Bruce Perens, Linus
    Torvalds, Richard M. Stallman, Eric S. Raymond, and the like. Granted, it is a fairly weighted and
    one-sided presentation (the narrative over Bill Gates' letter to hobbyists is especially laugh-inducing).
    But don't let that get in the way of what is a good watch.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5j8Wn">
      Hackers ‚Äî Wizards of the Electronic Age.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    It contains a bunch of legendary hackers, what else is there to say?
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>I still need to get to these...</h2>
  <p>
    Here are some more that are on my own must-read-this-in-the-future list, I just haven't gotten around
    to buying and reading them yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2eyXgau">
      Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I think the title says it all. Sounds like a fun read!
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5xw0T">
      A Few Good Men from UNIVAC (History of Computing).
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Based on how much I enjoyed The Soul Of A New Machine and how much I like computer history, I definitely
    want give this one a read.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5ogcS">
      Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, then Ignored, the First Personal Computer.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I've always had great respect and admiration for those that worked at Xerox PARC in its heyday. I think
    every geek should learn about the sheer amount of technologies that our modern computer world is built
    on that were all founded and built at Xerox PARC. An amazing story.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xKhruy">
      Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    It could be argued that the original Moog synthesizers are what really put synthesis on the map. Though
    I'm not much of a hardware geek myself, I have always been intrigued by the hardware side of things. This
    is definitely on my wish list.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5jT1F">
      Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    It seems ridiculous that I was a Microsoft employee for nearly 10 years and don't have a single book on
    Bill Gates (yet my bookshelf is stocked with books on Linus, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, etc.). This one
    looks like a fairly good read too.
