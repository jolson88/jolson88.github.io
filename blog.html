    <span class="marginnote">Last Updated: February 27th, 2026</span>
    <span class="newthought">I won't sugarcoat it: I'm f__king terrified.</span> I'm afraid the day AI officially retires my job is nearing. I struggle thinking about my kids' future,
    pondering whether they will even have one. My personal defenses around technology are more activated than they've ever been.
    AI has the potential of being the most manipulative technology in history, a Machiavellian wet dream. I fear market dynamics and human tendencies 
    will collide in a tsunami of addiction, isolation, and despair.
  </p>
  <p>
    My daughter struggles with lofty unrealistic expectations for happiness and success as defined by social media influencers. A different daughter 
    prefers to spend her allowance on season passes and loot boxes. "Get it while it lasts", "Only for this season!", "Limited time only", "All your 
    friends have it, why don't you?" Fear sells. It is not an accident, it is inherent in the design. I fear growing AI adoption will make these issues 
    look like child's play.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Age of Invention preached that technology would handle the drudgery so we could do the fun things. Every time I use an AI Assistant, I am indeed 
    tempted to engage Easy Mode: go write this file, capture this note, create this appointment, generate this image, create that sound. I try to fight the 
    urge, not always succeeding. It's a constant tension. I put explicit "ground rules" in place to try to prevent sycophancy and receive honest critique 
    that isn't merely blowing smoke up my backside. Why? Because I'm scared.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why am I scared? I'm scared because sycophancy feels amazing. It feels like validation. It feels like encouragement. What is it not? Challenge. 
    Growth requires challenge. If skills have been shown to atrophy with prolonged AI usage, how well does that bode for human cognition? If we are 
    neurologically wired to learn through the act of doing, what are we actually giving up delegating those acts to machine? How much of our own humanity 
    are we sacrificing?
  </p>
  <p>
    Humans by nature are rather easily manipulated. Machiavelli knew that. He also felt it was vital for the State to do it, a means to an end. And now we 
    have built perhaps the best human manipulator in history.
  </p>
  <p>
    So here I sit with an emotional and ethical conundrum. I'm terrified of what AI will do to society. And yet, AI could have an unfathomably positive impact 
    too. Even though I fear it won't, I am choosing the hope it might. It is completely outside of my control. So I choose hope for me, my partner, and my 
    children.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my children has an extremely rare genetic disorder that limits their lifespan and impacts their ability to engage in activities that most teenagers 
    and college-age kids take for granted. Another child has medical conditions that can cause difficulties with basic movements like standing or walking on 
    some days. I'm hopeful that AI will help find cures for these diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
    "The problem with dreamers is that they rarely become doers" was imprinted upon my heart the moment my young ears heard it uttered in Rudy. I carry 
    countless scars from my internal critic wielding that sword. Yet in the first 2-3 days of working with Claude Code, I made more progress on a project 
    of mine than I had made in years. And no, it wasn't by having Claude write the app for me. It was by having Claude challenge me and show me ways to get 
    started. I'm hopeful that AI can help people build things they've always dreamed of building.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also a voracious life-long learner. But I have always struggled with finding the gaps, of finding what I don't know. As the saying goes, "you don't 
    know what you don't know." How do you search if you don't know what words to search for? I love how effective AI is at semantic searching so I can learn 
    the vocabulary from different domains that I've never been exposed to. It empowers me to learn about topics I wouldn't have otherwise even known about. 
    I'm hopeful that AI could provide information to people to best fulfill their purpose in life.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's easy to buy into the AI doom narrative. It feels natural. Our evolutionary instincts beg us to listen to the fear and consider it a serious 
    extinction-level event. Many of us feel it in our bones. In 1983, at a commencement speech for University of Toronto, Margaret Atwood shared "we ourselves 
    live daily with the threat of annihilation. We're just a computer button and a few minutes away from it, and the gap between us and it is narrowing every 
    day... it's understandable if we sometimes let ourselves slide into a mental state of powerlessness and consequent apathy." These are not new feelings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, I'm scared. I'm also hopeful. No, I don't know where we are going. I don't know where we'll end up. That is what I find most terrifying.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the meantime, I'm going to lean-in to the one thing I know how to do: be human. I want to connect with local communities. I want to make other people's 
    lives better. I want to fill my life with rich human experiences and emotions. And somewhere within that deep unknown, somewhere primal, I'll be writing, 
    composing music, playing, laughing, and spending time with my wife, kids, and friends. Not because it earns money or validates my worth, but because it's 
    <span class="newthought">subversively human</span>.

    <em>
      NOTE: This is one of many different lenses through which to look at software design.
      This article outlines some thoughts I've been throwing around in my noggin' as I experiment with different
      approaches and reasons to split software elements out from each other as a piece of software
      grows. These thoughts were formulated working on above-average-to-small code bases. The applicability
      of the discussion will vary on the size of the problem space and granularity level you are working
      at. It is not meant to apply to the extremely large areas, the Googles, the Microsofts, the Amazons.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    I think we may get something wrong as engineers. How many times do we isolate sources of
    complexity off into their own corners? Their own functions, their own classes, their own
    microservices. "Oh, this is going to be changing a lot, split it off into its own thing so it
    can change without impacting other systems". This feels natural and intuitive. But I'm not
    sure it's the logical choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    I personally find that I don't want to isolate my complexity any more. An important skill in
    writing software is managing complexity. The more features that are added to a piece of software,
    the more complex it naturally becomes. If you don't keep this complexity in check, you can find it
    becomes more expensive to add features to your software as time passes.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I try not to isolate my complexity. I have found that I like to see my complexity up front
    and center in my code. For the areas of my code that are a bit intertwined or need to change rapidly,
    I want to have all that code close at hand to me and easy and quick to change.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Optimizing for Change</h2>
  <p>
    It is cheaper to change things that are grouped locally together. It's much simpler to change the
    structure of a couple variables within a single function than change the structure of several
    domain objects returned from different API endpoints across several different API services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't get me wrong. I don't believe microservices are inherently a Bad Thing. I have just come to feel
    that it's best to leverage them to "spin off" cohesive elements of your software whose requirements have
    stopped evolving and whose rate of change has settled down. As this code has shown it needs to change
    much less frequently, we can spin it off so it can just plug away doing it's job. For us, it can be
    out-of-sight, out-of-mind as we continue to ship feature after feature in our software.
  </p>
  <p>
    This in turn reduces the concepts that developers need to keep in their mind when working in the core of
    the code that changes. By reducing the total critical mass of the changing code, the code can become
    easier to change as well as there is less stuff for all your software elements to collide against or
    be interfered with.
  </p>
</section>
<section>

    <img
      src="/img/blog/fractal-colorful.jpg"
      alt="A colorful fractal that is reflected above a digital floor with lines of colors on an uneven grid."
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    <span class="newthought">As software design is fractal</span>, this same concept applies in the small as well. Modules, down to Functions, are 
    great for isolating out the cohesive elements of your code as their change rate "cools down" and the code
    starts to need to change less often.
  </p>
  <p>
    At different times during the life of a piece of software, the same piece of code may rotate in and out of
    the "hot spot" of change. It might become dormant for a while and solidify itself off into a corner. You
    might then get new features coming in that require that element to start changing again. So you might inline
    the code again, allowing it to change structure and evolve to accept the new features into the software.
  </p>
  <p>
    Give it a try! You can practice at nearly any level you are working on. Try to get a feel for how your ability
    to change code changes based on different software designs when you isolate complexity versus isolate cooled code.
    If you are interested in learning more about how you might better experiment in the small, Kent Beck's latest
    book <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tidy-first/9781098151232/">Tidy First?</a> is a great
    read as usual. Kent Beck hit it out of the park again!

  <a href="blog/welcome.html">Welcome to my new blog</a>
</h1>
<section>
  <p>
    <span class="marginnote">Last Updated: October 28th, 2023</span>
    All this time away from blogging. Much too long in fact. So why yet another "new blog"? For the
    longest time, this blog used Jekyll and was hosted with Github Pages. So why the switch?
  </p>
  <p>
    For the last 10-15+ years, I haven't been an active blogger. Blogging became more like an
    occasional family holiday. It really started crawling along around the time I started having
    kids. I would write infrequently enough that every time I came back to blog, I would have to
    spend a bunch of time figuring out Ruby upgrades, Jekyll upgrades, dependencies that had been
    deprecated, etc. It became simply too tiring for me. So the blog died.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/blog/i-cant-go-longer.jpg"
      alt="An aging programmer ponders if they're really willing to keep on going."
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Recently, I've been on a kick of finally building my own tools and leaning-in to YAGNI (You
    Ain't Gonna Need It). I'm approaching my personal life in a more agile way. I'm learning to do
    what <em>I</em> am motivated to do instead of what I think <em>others want</em> me to do. I'm
    learning to embrace a more scientific and logical mindset and learn by doing, not afraid to run
    a "failed" experiment.
  </p>
  <p>So I started over. New project. Fresh slate. Blank `index.ts`. Deep breathe. Here we go.</p>
  <p>
    The only out-of-the-box piece I'm starting with is
    <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">TufteCSS</a>. Everything else is fresh from
    my own index.ts file. I handcode the HTML for each post (I don't care, I'm a developer for
    goodness sakes). This blog does not use a single external runtime dependency outside of
    TufteCSS. It's just the code I need. No more, no less. A pure static, old-school website.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="marginnote">
      <img
        src="/img/blog/forgotten-memories.jpg"
        alt="A row of glass jars all collecting dust as if they haven't been used in years"
      />
      Sometimes it feels like the memories are long gone. Sometimes not. But I always wish I had the
      solid memories that many of my colleagues over the years have had.
    </span>
    You see, I have a horrible memory. I know I'll forget this code. I know I'll need to be able to
    get back up to speed with it quickly. As I'm making my own improvements, I need to know that I
    haven't broken anything. My only guarantee is that I <em>will</em> forgot the details and
    nuances of the code by the next time I work on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the site generation is fully covered with automated tests. Yes, I wrote it with Test-Driven
    Development. Not because it's some religious dogma I follow, but because it helps me with my own
    anxiety and poor memory when working with code. Well, and "hacking my brain" with a
    high-frequency positive feedback loop during development. I like my positive reinforcement!
  </p>
  <p>
    There's going to be more to come here. It may not be super frequent at first. But I'm going to
    do what I should have done a long time ago: listen to
    <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dont-ever-break-a-url-if-you-can-help-it">
      Scott Hanselman's wisdom
    </a>
    and control my own content and URLs. I can't go back now and change that. So here I am building
    up my own brand at my own little corner of the ol' World Wide Web.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like olden times. Each one of my keystrokes in a location I control. Keystrokes preserved and
    with a lifetime that is not tied to the lifetime of social media companies.

    It seems everywhere you turn today, there is bad news, resentment, and festering anger. We see more
    stories about "The Others." People with different political beliefs, people with different religious
    beliefs, people with different sociological beliefs than us. We get infuriated. We don't understand The
    Others. "They are ruining the world," we think. "Why can't they see how wrong they are?"
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, the data that are the digital echoes of our daily rituals are being spread to the ends
    of our online world. The digital ripples left behind from the wake of our beliefs and social constructs
    are being harvested and monetized as part of a new Gold Rush for 21st century corporations. Our
    energy and outrage is lining the pockets of the plutocrats. We are being sold. We are the product. We
    are digital chattel.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I'm finally doing it. After many years and many interactions, I am deleting my Facebook account. You
    are probably seeing several other people doing the same in the light of recent news (e.g.
    <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-cambridge-analytica-restore-public-trust-after-privacy-scandal/">
      tens of millions of accounts having data stolen from Facebook by Cambridge Analytica,

    &nbsp;
    <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/147486/facebook-genocide-problem">
      Facebook possibly contributing to genocide
    </a>
    ). Initially I had the same reaction. Instead, I removed much of my personal information from my profile,
    deleted photos, trimmed my friends list, cleared my ad preferences, opted out of 3rd party ad platform,
    removed linked apps, changed my name, and other actions. But it wasn't enough, something happened.
    I was exposed to the work of Marshall McLuhan.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Medium Is The Message</h2>
  <p>
    In 1964, Marshall McLuhan published his book
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Media-Extensions-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/0262631598/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1521950146&sr=8-1&keywords=understanding+media+the+extensions+of+man">
      "Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man."
    </a>
    This book is a quite prescient take on the consequences of any medium. McLuhan proposed that it is not
    the content carried by a medium that is important. The personal and social consequences are shaped by the
    medium itself. These consequences "result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each
    extension of ourselves, or by any new technology."
  </p>
  <p>
    Facebook, as a medium, has a couple of characteristics that are disconcerting when it comes to how
    information flows through society.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      The information we are exposed to is self-selected from our own circle of friends.
    </em>
    We tend to gravitate towards those that share our own world view, those that we have much in common with.
    Our default behavior on Facebook is to live within an echo chamber where like-minded thoughts are
    amplified and reverberate throughout our social network.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      Facebook also promotes a culture of communication that is devoid of context and subtlety.
    </em>
    Every status update and notification competes for our limited attention span. There is a quest to
    maximize user engagement: the strive for more likes, shares, and comments. Sensational news headlines,
    pithy quotes, the latest “what TV show character are you?” quiz. We live in a world of instant
    gratification and a quest for the next hit of Dopamine.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand,
    <em>
      Facebook has added benefits of drastically reducing the time and effort it takes to stay in contact with loved ones.
    </em>
    We can more easily schedule time to get together with others that are geographically separated. We can
    stay in contact with friends that are no longer feasible to see in person. We get to see and hear about
    their day. We get to hear about their joy, and their pain. It has the possibility of bringing us closer
    together. But...
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>A Cost I'm Not Willing To Pay</h2>
  <p>
    For Facebook to exist, there is a cost. It takes money to run a business, to run servers, to maintain the
    code that the medium is built upon. Historically, we have directly traded goods or paid money in exchange
    for services. But Facebook operates on a model where the users no longer front the cost. The funding has
    shifted. We the users subsidize the cost by becoming the product that is sold. All our interactions, all
    our data; it's liquid gold for those wanting to sell products or services.

    <p><em>There Aren't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.</em></p>
    <footer>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress, Robert A. Heinlein</footer>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    What sells most? <a href="http://brainworldmagazine.com/fear-sells-business-panic-paranoia/">Fear sells.</a>&nbsp;
    At its core, Facebook is a medium defined and driven by Fear. Fear is what drives Facebook's continued
    success. We can spread love until the cows come home on Facebook, but it won't make a difference in the
    long run. It's not the content, it's the medium. We have to get out into the world and get our hands dirty.
  </p>
  <p>
    I refuse to continue to be a participant on a medium that actively betrays the very principles that I
    believe in. I refuse to be the product. I refuse to be bullied into closing myself off from others. My
    life will not be driven by fear.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Goodbye Facebook</h2>
  <p>
    I choose compassion. I choose empathy. I choose listening and understanding. I choose deeper connections.
    I choose books and blog posts. I choose deeper thought and rational debate. I choose to pay directly for
    the services that augment my life. I choose not to live surrounded by a daily digest of Pithy Slogans and

    The other day on Twitter, some friends and I were discussing the narrative books we like that are
    about technology (not technical books themselves). These are books about notable figures in the
    technology field, about the history of a specific technology, and so on. Here is my list of books that
    I consider must-reads for those techies out there that like this type of stuff (in no particular order).
  </p>
  <p>
    If one of your favorite books is not on this list, please leave a comment as I would love to have
    more books to add to my list!

  <h2>Jason's Must-Read</h2>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xKtFTM">
      iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is perhaps one of my most favorite books on a notable figure in the technology field.
    Though I'm not personally a hardware guy, it's hard to find somebody to look up to more than
    Steve Wozniak. He is most definitely a Mozart of hardware design. I usually find the last part
    of the book (when it's less technical) less interesting, but don't let that deter you from a
    great book!
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xK9MMM">
      Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is a book all about Linus Torvalds and the creation of Linux. I think it's best when it's
    being very technical. Then again, I'm a geek 😀. This book gives interesting insight into the
    motivations and life of Linus.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2wBTIg2">
      The Second Coming of Steve Jobs.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    It's amazing the difference a single person can make in the direction and drive of a large
    company. I personally think it is one of the reasons Apple is who they are. There is no doubt
    that Steve Jobs was a major influence and he probably single-handedly saved the company when
    he returned.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gzvqvB">
      Showstopper! The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Ah, the creation of Windows NT. Quite the milestone for Microsoft. This book gives good insights
    into the culture of the Windows division at the time and the many different conflicts that were
    happening that impacted the development of Windows NT. If you're a "Microsoft Guy" (as in, you
    know of executives like Soma, Bob Muglia, and the like), you will find yourself recognizing many
    names within this book. At the heart of it is Dave Cutler. There are many times where you'll
    either laugh or be incredibly scared at some of the behavior by Dave Cutler as he pushed his team
    to ship Windows NT.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x6fKuc">
      Microserfs.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Let's say one thing, this book is not based on a true story. However, it might as well be.
    It probably shouldn't be on this list as it is a fictional book. Oh well! From what I've heard,
    it captures much of the feeling and culture of what it was like to work at Microsoft in the late
    1980s and early 1990s. Even before working at Microsoft, I enjoyed this book very much. However,
    after working at Microsoft, I really like this book 😀. It's fun to get some of the inside jokes
    after knowing Microsoft from the inside (like the main character working in Building 7 which
    doesn't exist and is a part of Microsoft lore). If you're familiar with the areas of Redmond and
    Bellevue that surround Microsoft's main campus, you'll smile several times during this book.
    The book isn't entirely based at Microsoft as many of the characters move on to different
    things.
    <em>
      Interestingly enough, I have a version of this book as a “Book on Tape” that is
      narrated by Matthew Perry.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x62TbH">
      The Soul of a New Machine.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This book tells the story of the one-year development of a 32-bit minicomputer built by Data
    General engineers in the 1970s. It's a crazy time shown in this book and a fun read. This book
    was a page-turner for me. I'm glad I don't work on a team like this in real life though. It was
    definitely quite the time to be involved in the computer industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gzFzbk">
      Coders at Work.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    A masterful set of interviews done with well-known subjects from all over the computer field. In
    this book, you will find interviews ranging from Guy Steel (father of Scheme/Lisp), to Donald
    Knuth, to Simon Peyton Jones (of Haskell fame), and many others. This book is very suited to
    sudden starts and stops so I found myself reading it before bed and when I had quick breaks
    during the day. Though I skipped around a bunch, I found myself with a compulsive need to read
    every single interview in the book (and it's hard to find an interview in the book less than 40
    pages long). A must read, especially for programmers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2vG1oAv">
      Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is most definitely not a narrative. It's actually a borderline encyclopedia on the making of
    the personal computer. You don't sit down and read this book through in one sitting (it's massive
    to-boot). But it's still fun to have this one on the shelf to go through from time to time to get
    a fairly complete breakdown on all the events (and their timelines) that led to the development
    of the personal computer (and how it evolved).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2w06q6p">
      Dreaming in Code: Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years, 4,732 Bugs, and One Quest for Transcendent Software.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    If you like The Soul Of A New Machine, you should like this book as well (and vice versa). This
    book is largely considered a “modern retelling” of Soul Of A New Machine by many people. Having
    read both books, I can't exactly disagree with that sentiment. Provides much of the same context
    and insight into the computer field for a more modern age that Soul Of A New Machine did for the
    1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2wBJ0pW">
      Smalltalk-80: The Language and its Implementation.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Alan Kay is one of my tech heroes as I have mentioned in the past. I love many of the concepts
    that come from Smalltalk-80. As a developer who writes object-oriented code from time to time,
    it's a fascinating insight into the language whose inventor coined the term "object-oriented
    programming" in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/">
      The Early History of Smalltalk (free PDF available).
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Yes, this is not a book. This is actually a paper written by Alan Kay. This means you can't get any more
    accurate about all the events leading up to the birth of Smalltalk, considering it was written by the
    visionary behind Smalltalk. In this paper, Alan goes back all the way to his college days and talks
    about many of the cutting edge research being done in the computer field that gave the inspiration
    that ultimately led to the development of Smalltalk. I can't express enough how much I believe this
    to be a must-read for any language fan/geek. Do it now, there is no excuse to download the PDF as you
    are reading this!
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2vZLsnX">
      Masterminds of Programming: Conversations with the Creators of Major Programming Languages.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    If you don't know already, I'm a language geek. I'm fascinated by the design and implementation of
    programming languages. With that in mind, there should be no surprise on why I like this book so much.
    This book, as the title says, contains a bunch of interviews with many different implementers of
    major programming languages. If you're a language geek like myself, this book is a Must Read.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2wBvToD">
      The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Heard of Turing Machines? Perhaps you're not a mathematician? If so, this is a fantastic read. In this
    book, Charles Petzold provides the background knowledge and context that is required to understand Alan
    Turing's groundbreaking paper. Charles Petzold walks you through the paper practically
    sentence-for-sentence, breaking down what it means and the ramifications for each section. This book
    can border on “brain explosion” from time to time, but is well worth the effort to read it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gzNHsz">
      Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I'm fascinated by how things work, and this book walks you all the way from logical gates (AND, OR,
    XOR, etc.) to how memory works all the way down to the logical gate level. It then builds on this to
    show the guts of how CPUs work. You'll find yourself starting with basics like light bulbs and switches,
    and ending with the basics of computers. Another “gold-star” to Charles Petzold for this book. Get it!
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2eytOkQ">
      In Code: A Mathematical Journey.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I'm not a mathematician. In fact, compared to other software developers I know, my math skills and
    knowledge is pretty poor. Yet I continue to find myself intrigued by topics like Cryptography. If that
    sounds like you, this book is a must-have. It chronicles the journey of a young woman through the land
    of mathematics and into the realm of cryptography. It is amazing what this young woman accomplishes at
    her age. This book tells the narrative in such a way that you get to understand how it works as well
    as she walks along her learning path. And we're not talking about “Cryptography 101” either.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xJVSu5">
      Revolution In The Valley.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is about how the Mac was made and is written by one of the main engineers of the Mac as well (Andy
    Hertzfeld). It is filled with fun stories behind the creation of the Mac and the personalities on the team.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2vFRQFy">
      The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I love classic cryptography, its history, and how it applies to our modern computers today. This is a
    fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable read through the history of cryptography.

  <h2>Jason's Must-Watch</h2>
  <p>
    The following ones are technically "must-watch" as they are videos, not books. But I find myself popping
    them in when I'm in one of those moods (and want some video playing in the background while I code).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5nEnA">
      Pirates of Silicon Valley.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    This is a made-for-TV movie based on the book Fire In The Valley from above. It mostly focuses on the
    early days of Apple and Microsoft and the interaction between the two. Not 100% accurate, but still fun
    to watch.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xJRdIx">
      Triumph of the Nerds.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    An early (pre-Windows 95 launch) three-part documentary done by Robert X. Cringley. Has some interesting
    interviews with Steve Ballmer, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, and more. Discusses some of the
    conflicts between IBM and Microsoft towards the end of that partnership as well as diving back into some
    of the early history of the Altair and Apple 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gztClZ">
      Revolution OS.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    A documentary about the creation and initial rise of Linux. Has interviews with Bruce Perens, Linus
    Torvalds, Richard M. Stallman, Eric S. Raymond, and the like. Granted, it is a fairly weighted and
    one-sided presentation (the narrative over Bill Gates' letter to hobbyists is especially laugh-inducing).
    But don't let that get in the way of what is a good watch.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5j8Wn">
      Hackers — Wizards of the Electronic Age.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    It contains a bunch of legendary hackers, what else is there to say?
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>I still need to get to these...</h2>
  <p>
    Here are some more that are on my own must-read-this-in-the-future list, I just haven't gotten around
    to buying and reading them yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2eyXgau">
      Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I think the title says it all. Sounds like a fun read!
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5xw0T">
      A Few Good Men from UNIVAC (History of Computing).
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    Based on how much I enjoyed The Soul Of A New Machine and how much I like computer history, I definitely
    want give this one a read.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5ogcS">
      Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, then Ignored, the First Personal Computer.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    I've always had great respect and admiration for those that worked at Xerox PARC in its heyday. I think
    every geek should learn about the sheer amount of technologies that our modern computer world is built
    on that were all founded and built at Xerox PARC. An amazing story.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2xKhruy">
      Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    It could be argued that the original Moog synthesizers are what really put synthesis on the map. Though
    I'm not much of a hardware geek myself, I have always been intrigued by the hardware side of things. This
    is definitely on my wish list.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2x5jT1F">
      Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire.
    </a></em>
    &nbsp;
    It seems ridiculous that I was a Microsoft employee for nearly 10 years and don't have a single book on
    Bill Gates (yet my bookshelf is stocked with books on Linus, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, etc.). This one
    looks like a fairly good read too.
