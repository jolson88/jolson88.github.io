    All this time away from blogging. Much too long in fact. So why yet another
    "new blog"? For the longest time, this blog used Jekyll and was hosted with
    Github Pages. So why the switch?
  </p>
  <p>
    For the last 10-15+ years, I haven't been an active blogger. Blogging became
    more like an occasional family holiday. It really started crawling along
    around the time I started having kids. I would write infrequently enough
    that every time I came back to blog, I would have to spend a bunch of time
    figuring out Ruby upgrades, Jekyll upgrades, dependencies that had been
    deprecated, etc. It became simply too tiring for me. So the blog died.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/blog/i-cant-go-longer.png"
      alt="An aging programmer ponders if they're really willing to keep on going."
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Recently, I've been on a kick of finally building my own tools and
    leaning-in to YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It). I'm approaching my personal
    life in a more agile way. I'm learning to do what <em>I</em> am motivated to
    do instead of what I think <em>others want</em> me to do. I'm learning to
    embrace a more scientific and logical mindset and learn by doing, not afraid
    to run a "failed" experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I started over. New project. Fresh slate. Blank `index.ts`. Deep breathe.
    Here we go.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only out-of-the-box piece I'm starting with is
    <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">TufteCSS</a>. Everything
    else is fresh from my own index.ts file. I handcode the HTML for each post
    (I don't care, I'm a developer for goodness sakes). This blog does not use a
    single external runtime dependency outside of TufteCSS. It's just the code I
    need. No more, no less. A pure static, old-school website.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="marginnote">
      <img
        src="/img/blog/forgotten-memories.png"
        alt="A row of glass jars all collecting dust as if they haven't been used in years"
      />
      Sometimes it feels like the memories are long gone. Sometimes not. But I
      always wish I had the solid memories that many of my colleagues over the
      years have had.
    </span>
    You see, I have a horrible memory. I know I'll forget this code. I know I'll
    need to be able to get back up to speed with it quickly. As I'm making my
    own improvements, I need to know that I haven't broken anything. My only
    guarantee is that I <em>will</em> forgot the details and nuances of the code
    by the next time I work on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the site generation is fully covered with automated tests. Yes, I wrote
    it with Test-Driven Development. Not because it's some religious dogma I
    follow, but because it helps me with my own anxiety and poor memory when
    working with code. Well, and "hacking my brain" with a high-frequency
    positive feedback loop during development. I like my positive reinforcement!
  </p>
  <p>
    There's going to be more to come here. It may not be super frequent at
    first. But I'm going to do what I should have done a long time ago: listen
    to
    <a
      href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dont-ever-break-a-url-if-you-can-help-it"
    >
      Scott Hanselman's wisdom
    </a>
    and control my own content and URLs. I can't go back now and change that. So
    here I am building up my own brand at my own little corner of the ol' World
    Wide Web.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like olden times. Each one of my keystrokes in a location I control.
    Keystrokes preserved and with a lifetime that is not tied to the lifetime of
    social media companies.
