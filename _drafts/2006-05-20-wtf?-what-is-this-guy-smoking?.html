title: WTF? What is this guy smoking?
---

<p>
   I just happened to have the television on while writing my winning entry in the GWB
   gaming contest and the Andy Milonakis Show just came on. OMG. WTF?!?!?! Is this actually
   a show? And why am I still watching? OMG, LMAO, ROFL. I can't believe this show. It
   just keeps getting better and better. 
</p>
<p>
   Okay, I'm just speechless. What is up with this rapping? How old is this kid? OMG.
   I can't take my eyes off the screen, I'm transfixed. This is nuts. It's utterly crap
   but it's utterly funny. "Pork fat in my Sippy Cup"???????? Okay, I'm..... just......
   shocked. And why am I laughing?!?!?!?!?
