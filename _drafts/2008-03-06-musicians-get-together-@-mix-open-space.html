title: Musicians Get-Together @ MIX Open Space
---

<p>Jason Mauer and I are doing an Open Space session tonight @ 6:30pm in the Open Space Theatre at MIX 08. If you are a musician who happens to be a computer geek for a living, come on by, chill out, and enjoy. Hope to see you there!</p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=8057572" width="1" height="1">
