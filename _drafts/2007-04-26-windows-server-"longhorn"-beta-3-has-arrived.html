---

<p>Well, it's official. Beta 3 of Windows Server "Longhorn" <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/longhorn/default.mspx">has launched</a>. With it, I finally get to release some of the work I've been working on lately.</p> <p>If you are a developer, I encourage to take a look at "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jolson/archive/2007/04/26/top-ways-to-light-up-your-apps-on-windows-server-longhorn.aspx">The Top Ways To Light Up Your Apps On Windows Server 'Longhorn'</a>" that was just launched today.&nbsp;It outlines key ways that you, the developer, can leverage all the new and improved enhancements to the Server platform to really make your applications shine in a whole new light.</p> <p>I encourage any of you with access to Beta 3 to try it out. Windows Server "Longhorn" is quickly shaping up to be the best Server release from Microsoft ever. &nbsp;</p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2277835" width="1" height="1">
