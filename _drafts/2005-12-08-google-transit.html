   Yup, yet another ridiculous ploy to take over the world by Google (when will we see
   Transit Live, Microsoft? (::end scarcasm::)). All I have to say is: COOL!!!! (and
   how convenient, the first release covers just the Portland, Oregon area which I happen
   to be from; Coincedence? I THINK NOT!).
