title: Oops, I Did It Again
---

<p>
   Well, my private life is officially over. I finally made the biggest mistake (read:
   "best decision of my life" (behind marrying my absolutely gorgeous bride of course
   (Hi Honey!!)). I went out and bought World Of Warcraft. After not being able to relax
   and play games for a couple of weeks due to all the programming leading up to Code
   Camp, I decided to play games ALL weekend. And you know what? It was everything that
   I hoped it would be. Call me a slacker, but I enjoy relaxing by parking my butt in
   front of a monitor and playing video games. 
</p>
<p>
   WoW is just as beautiful as Guild Wars and, save for teleportation routines, has no
   load screens once you're in game (Note To Game Makers: LOAD TIMES SUCK). Being the
   absolute loser that I am, I actually found myself spending a decent amount of my in-game
   time fishing, cook, picking plants (aka Herbalism), and making potions. Over the weekend,
   I was able to get my character up to Level 12.
</p>
<p>
   My character is a Tauren Druid (say hello to my Bear Form bizitch). I'm located on
   the Draenor server and my character's name is Rendru. Caveat: While Rendru might sound
   decent and creative, I must admit that there is absolutely NO creativity to the name
   (tauREN DRUid). You see? Anyways, if you're around, ping me some time. I'll probably
   be soloing for quite a while (until I get to a certain point) but that doesn't mean
   we can't chat, right?
</p>
<p>
   Anyways, what does this mean for all of you? Bluntly, I may not get the articles up
   as fast as I possibly would.
