title: Another VB.NET/C# Comparison
---

<p>
   This was just too good to possibly pass up. I was chatting with <a href="http://www.blogusmaximus.com">Chris
   Williams</a> over messenger about his <a href="http://www.geekswithblogs.net/cwilliams/archive/2005/11/20/60657.aspx">new
   endeavor</a> to learn C#. And this is what he had to say:
</p>
<dir>
   <font size=1> 
   <p>
      VB.NET is the girl you go out with in high school because you know you'll get some,
      even though you're really interested in the prettier girl (C#), who may or may not
      give it up.
   </p>
</dir>> 
<dir>
   <font size=1> 
   <p>
      Then you end up stuck with her... 
   </p>
   <font size=1> 
   <p>
      eventually you start to love her, despite her flaws... but you always wonder what
      it would have been like...
   </p>
   </font> 
   <p>
      &nbsp;
   </p>
</dir>> 
<p>
   Quite a way to compare two programming languages. Leave it to us Geeks to compare
   languages to girls =P.
