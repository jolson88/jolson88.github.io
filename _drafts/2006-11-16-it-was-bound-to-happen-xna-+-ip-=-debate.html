title: It was bound to happen - XNA + IP = debate
---

<p>
   Well, it was bound to happen. Now you have some lawyers (or at least, people WELL
   more versed in the law than puny little me) stepping up to talk about the affect on
   Intellectual Property with the upcoming release of XNA. <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/myturn/?id=14458">Check
   it out here</a>.
</p>
<p>
   I would comment myself but seeing that A) I'm practically a drooling moron when it
   comes to law (I probably couldn't even play one on TV (then again, I can't act worth
   crappola)) and B) It's like 12:30 in the morning and I'm friggen' tired and need some
   sleep, so technically I haven't "read it" completely yet.
</p>
<p>
   Of course, it's probably a good thing I haven't read it. It would only come out sounding
   like some kind of dramatic space-opera poised to knock off George Lucas to become
   the first monstrous Space Guerilla to conquer "He-Who-Created-The-Dreaded-Jar-Jar-And-Should-Be-Killed-For-It"
   Lucas at King Of Space Mountain (and I'm not talking about that crappy little Disneyland
   ride Space Mountain either, "for the record" (as they would say in legalese (huh,
   who'd have figured, perhaps I can play a lawyer on TV after all seeing that I have
   the legalese down; that was easy)). 
</p>
<p>
   Anyway, like if you're into the whole Intellectual Property / Copyrights / Trademarks
   / Legal Issues that come about in regards to software, like, you should <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/myturn/?id=14458">check
   the article out</a>, and stuff. Peace!
