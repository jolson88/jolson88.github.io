title: At MIX08 for the week
---

<p>Hey all, I will be at the wonderful Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada this week working at the MIX08 conference. <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/drobbins/">Drew Robbins</a> and I are a couple of the guys &quot;behind&quot; Open Space @ MIX, so we will most likely be parked in the Open Space area most of the week. Feel free to stop by and say hello if you are at the event.</p>  <p>Originally, I was the owner of what used to be known as &quot;MIX Chat&quot; (usually referred to as &quot;Ask The Experts&quot; in Microsoft Conference speak), and Drew was in charge of Open Mic. Drew had the idea to bring in the Open Space idea into the conference instead of the old Open Mic method. When he approached me about the idea, I loved it and jumped in as well. So, now, there is no longer a &quot;MIX Chat&quot; this year as we are looking at integrating it more directly into the conference itself. I guess we'll see this week how it works out!</p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=8032133" width="1" height="1">
