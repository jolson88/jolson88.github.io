title: An actually funny video about Windows Server
---

<p>Well, at least I found it funny. A coworker <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/pages/about-lone-server.aspx">brought this</a> to my attention today. I thought it was pretty clever and enjoyed it. Then again, I've known for a while how great Windows Server 2008 is :). Here's an excerpt:</p>  <p><em>Once I was almost famous. For years, my friends and I were on the front lines: we were the Windows Server 2003 servers that powered Microsoft.com, one of the hottest Web sites in the world. Then, early last summer, everything changed. Quietly, without warning, the new kids took over. Windows Server 2008. Yes, I know, the product&#8217;s not even done yet. These were Beta 3 servers, for Pete&#8217;s sake. Long way from prime time. But there they were, humming away. No problems. All of &#8216;em on Windows Server 2008. Except me. The last Windows Server 2003 left at Microsoft.com.</em></p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/pages/about-lone-server.aspx">Enjoy</a>!</p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=7080606" width="1" height="1">
