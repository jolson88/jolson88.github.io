title: Windows Server &quot;Longhorn&quot; - Beta 3 Has Arrived!
---

<p>
   Well, it's official. Beta 3 of Windows Server "Longhorn" <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/longhorn/default.mspx">has
   launched</a>. With it, I finally get to release some of the work I've been working
   on lately.
</p>
<p>
   If you are a developer, I encourage to take a look at "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jolson/archive/2007/04/26/top-ways-to-light-up-your-apps-on-windows-server-longhorn.aspx">The
   Top Ways To Light Up Your Apps On Windows Server 'Longhorn'</a>" that was just launched
   today.&nbsp;It outlines key ways that you, the developer, can leverage all the new
   and improved enhancements to the Server platform to really make your applications
   shine in a whole new light.
</p>
<p>
   I encourage any of you with access to Beta 3 to try it out. Windows Server "Longhorn"
   is quickly shaping up to be the best Server release from Microsoft ever. &nbsp;
