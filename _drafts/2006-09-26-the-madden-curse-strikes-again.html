title: The Madden Curse Strikes Again
---

<p>
   Why Shaun, Why?!?!? Why did you have to be on the cover of Madden this year? Yes folks,
   the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_curse#The_.22Madden_Curse.22">Madden
   Curse</a> strikes again. The Madden Curse has been going strong since 2001, and it
   appears the trend has continued. 
</p>
<p>
   Tonight, it was accounced that Shaun Alexander would be out "indefinitely" <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2602571">with
   a broken foot</a>. What a surprise. I suppose those of us that knew about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_curse#The_.22Madden_Curse.22">Madden
   Curse</a> knew that it was a matter of "when", not "if." Damn. It's a good thing the
   Seahawks have a good backup running back like Maurice Morris (former UofO stand-out). 
</p>
<p>
   Oy!
