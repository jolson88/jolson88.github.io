title: More trash talk
---

<p>
   I noticed that in Chris's "<a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/cwilliams/archive/2006/05/23/79345.aspx">latest
   post</a>", he is merely talking about what technologies he will use, what the game
   will be, etc. Chris, I'm going to give you a little tip. If you want to win the contest,&nbsp;you
   have to&nbsp;WRITE SOME DAMN CODE! It's ironic that at the start of your project,
   you were trash talking me about how I wouldn't get anything done. Where are you now?
   Huh? For goodness sakes, a guy who has never written a game is <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/rmogstad/archive/2006/05/23/79395.aspx">further
   along than you</a> :P. I'm just curious, how does that feel?
</p>
<p>
   Although, I must fully admit, I want to see some updates from Chris on writing code
   as I want to be able to steal any ideas if necessary to guarantee my victory over
   him :) (I could care less about winning the 360 as long as I beat Chris (and George,
   for that matter :))). I also like reading about people's progress on their games as
   I think the "behind the scenes" aspect is one of the best things you get with blogging.
</p>
<p>
   So, get to blogging&nbsp;tattoo boy :P.
</p>
<p>
   On a different note: George and Rick, you are still in the Portland area right? If
   so, we should geek out on developing our games together some time :).
