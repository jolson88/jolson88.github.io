title: Rory Joining Channel 9
---

<p>
   Yay, I can finally talk about this. For those of you that haven't heard yet, the incomparable <a href="http://www.neopoleon.com">Rory
   Blyth</a>, the <a href="http://www.thesmartestman.com/">smartest man</a>, is <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=237876">joining
   the C9 team</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Rory is going to make a GREAT addition to the C9 team and I expect to see some great
   stuff coming from him in the future. Of course, I'm also psyched because it means
   that he will most likely be working just one or two hallways away from me :). 
</p>
<p>
   Congrats Rory!
