   blogged</a> some screenshots&nbsp;from&nbsp;a new tool from <a href="http://neosmart.net/">NeoSmart</a> called <a href="http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1">EasyBCD</a>.

   EasyBCD is NeoSmart Technologies' multiple award-winning answer to tweaking the new
   Windows Vista bootloader. With EasyBCD, almost anything is possible. Setting up and
   configuring Windows boot entries is simple, and there is no easier way to quickly
   boot right into Linux, Mac OS X, or BSD straight from the Windows Vista bootloader
   - on the fly, no expert knowledge needed! 
<p>
   EasyBCD is geared for users of all kinds. Whether you just want to add an entry to
   your old XP partition or want to create a duplicate for testing purposes; if you're
   interested in debugging the Windows Kernel or hectuple-booting your seven test operating
   systems, EasyBCD is the key. 
<p>
   Automated MBR and BCD backups, boot sector restore kits, support for a dozen+ operating
   systems, detailed configuration of all boot entries, and award-winning guaranteed
