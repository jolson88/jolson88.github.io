title: Here I Come Bib!!!
---

<p>
   YAY!!!!!! I'm extremely excited right now. Tomorrow, I am getting my new sofa and
   chair delivered. Finally, a place for me to relax on and allow my IQ to drop to 12.
   Tomorrow, after I'm done working, I am planning on sitting on my new chair, stairing
   at the ceiling, and slobbering all evening long. YAY!
</p>
<p>
   Who knows, maybe I'll pick up some Depends so I don't have to miss out on any relaxing
   bliss!!!

   YIKES! I just realized how much this entire post really drove home the fact that I'm
   a lazy bastard. Oh well, I've already warned my wife that there is NOTHING getting
   done around the house this weekend. You know what I'm going to do ALL WEEKEND? NOTHING.
   Well, not nothing. I suppose if you got technical I'll be celebrating my severe case
   of Sloth. Oh yeah, chair + drink + video games = Jason Happy Happy Long Time.
