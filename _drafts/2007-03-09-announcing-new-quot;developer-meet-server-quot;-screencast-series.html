<p>
   Welcome everybody to the inaugural, first ever, grand opening, “opening the doors
   to the public” celebration day kick-off for the new “Developer, Meet Server” screencast
   series. I am your sincere, humble (as ever), gracious and wonderful host/chef/tour
   guide Jason Olson. 
<p>
   In this series of screencasts we will be diving through all the various cool developer-oriented
   enhancements on the Windows Server "Longhorn" platform that developers can leverage
   to build robust and powerful applications. Specifically, in this first screencast,
   we will take a quick peek at Transactional NTFS. In future screencasts, we will go
   into a more detailed look at Transactional NTFS, so think of this as a quick introduction. 
<p>
   The screencast can be found in one of the main tubes on the Intarw3b known as the
   ever-lovely Channel 9: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=289816">http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=289816</a>.

   So sit back, grab a cup of coffee/tea/InsertYourFavoriteLocalTastyBeverageHere, and
   enjoy this screencast.
