title: Work blogging centrally on MSDN now
---

<p>
   Just an FYI for my readers. If you read this blog merely for technical enjoyment,
   all my "work-related" type posts will be done on my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jolson/">blog
   over on MSDN</a>. 
</p>
<p>
   The reason I am doing this is that I want&nbsp;this blog to become more personal (like
   Rory's blog) and center more around my family and hobbies. Since the two areas are
   very different and aren't nearly as related as they were in the past, I made the decision
   to separate the two. I'm sorry if this inconveniences you, but I'm tired of not posting
   personal stuff to this blog because it doesn't contribute to my "work".
</p>
<p>
   So expect some upcoming posts on my new hobby coming up :).
