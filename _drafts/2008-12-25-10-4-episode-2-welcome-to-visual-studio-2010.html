First of all, thanks to everybody who helped get the word out on the launch of this new show on Channel 9 by blogging, tweeting, or spreading the word using other ways. There is no doubt in our minds that the launch of this new show wouldn’t have been nearly as successful without all of you! </p>  <p>In this second episode of 10-4, we’ll take a very high-level look at Visual Studio 2010. We’ll discuss what types of features you can expect to see in Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4.0 depending on what type of developer you are. And lastly we’ll go ahead and dive into a revised area of Visual Studio: the Start Page. The Start Page in Visual Studio 2010 has been revised to be XAML-based and allows full customization. </p>  <p>In future episodes we’ll dive more deeply into the technical underpinnings of Visual Studio 2010 and the .NET Framework 4.0, but for this second episode we want to make sure everybody gains an understanding of what different areas are being focused in Visual Studio 2010. While an overview is given, there is only so much time and so many features we can talk about. So if you don't see something mentioned, don't worry as we have a lot more information to dive into in the coming weeks and months. </p>  <p>For more 10-4 episodes, be sure to visit:   <br /><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/10-4/">http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/10-4/</a></p>  <p>Over and out! </p> <img src="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/128162.aspx" width="1" height="1" />
