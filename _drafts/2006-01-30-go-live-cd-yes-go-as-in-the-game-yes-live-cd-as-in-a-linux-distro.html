title: Go Live CD - Yes, Go as in the Game, Yes, Live CD as in a Linux Distro
---

<p>
   I came across <a href="http://www.hikarunix.org/">this distro</a> yesterday. What
   can I say? Okay, yes, I'm a geek :). I'm wanting to learn the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29">game
   Go</a> and get into it a bit so I was looking for free Go resources. What did I find?
   Well, a live cd linux distro specifically tailored for playing Go :). It comes with
   a slew of tutorials, a full local copy of a popular Go wiki, a Go server, a bunch
   of Go clients as well as Go game file editors/viewers. 
</p>
<p>
   I downloaded it last night and captured the ISO into a Virtual Machine in Virtual
   PC. Now I'm rocking and rolling :). If Go has ever caught your attention, give <a href="http://www.hikarunix.org">Hikarunix</a> a
   go (pun intended (yeah, I know, I suck at being funny sometimes (okay, all the time,
   I admit it))). 
</p>
<p>
   P.S. See folks, I'm not dead :). I've just been _really_ busy with work and family
   lately. Not much else to post as of yet.
