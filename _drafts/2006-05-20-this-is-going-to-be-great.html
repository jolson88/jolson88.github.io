title: This is going to be great
---

<p>
   Okay, I'm taking a bit of a break from the trash talking for this post. I have to
   say one thing: I'm really excited about how this game development contest is shaping
   up. It looks like <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/clingermangw/archive/2006/05/20/79015.aspx">George
   is off to a great start</a>. I read through his design document and if he can complete
   his game, I think that I for one will definitely enjoy it and that he would stand
   a good chance at winning that 360. I really love reading about other people writing
   games and I have a feeling that there is going to be no shortage of that in the next
   40+ days. 
</p>
<p>
   Another thing that excites me is that, if this continues, it might be able to bring
   some good attention to leveraging&nbsp;.NET as a hobbyist game developer since you
   can do it for completely free now. 
</p>

   Anyways, sorry for the diversion. Back to the trash talking and game programming :).
