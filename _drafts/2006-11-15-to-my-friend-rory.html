title: To my friend Rory
---

As became known to many of us recently, Rory is feeling <a href="http://neopoleon.com/home/blogs/neo/archive/2006/11/14/22809.aspx">a
bit disenfranchised</a> to the whole blogging scene. In truly ironic fashion of his
post, I've made this comic for him, to cheer him up and stuff. 
<p>
   Rory, I might not be half as funny as you are, and I might not be that good of a writer,
   but I'll be damned if I won't at least give it a go.
