title: Halo 2
---

Well, evidently while I was taking a blogging/development vacation, there was a lot of stuff that I happened to miss. This the first one: more videos of Halo 2 from E3 2004. To say that I am *highly* anticipating the arrival of this game would be a *great* understatement. While I can't think of a clever quip of just how excited I am, I'm sure that many of you astute readers out there can conjure one up really quickly. You can find the videos over at Team XBox: <A href="http://previews.teamxbox.com/xbox/720/Halo-2/p1">http://previews.teamxbox.com/xbox/720/Halo-2/p1</A>. Enjoy, my friends! I know I did!!<img src ="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/5650.aspx" width = "1" height = "1" />
