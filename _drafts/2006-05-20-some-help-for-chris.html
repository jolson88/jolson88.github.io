title: Some help for Chris
---

<p>
   Well, it looks like Tattoo-Boy is back to his <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/cwilliams/archive/2006/05/19/78992.aspx">old
   tricks</a>. With all the time he is spending on writing comics (don't quit your day
   job, buddy), it's obvious that he needs some help to get going in this project. In
   that vein, I have put together this project plan that he can use to help him "compete"
   in this contest (and by "compete", I mean write useless code while thinking that you
   stand any chance to beat the Almighty George of the Jungle):
</p>
<p>
   Day 1: Buy book "Learn to Program VB in 21 Days"
</p>
<p>
   Day 2-25: Read book (&lt;-- Notice the extra days, that helps give some padding because
   of the slower mental processes due to the amount of absorbed tattoo ink over the years
   (I've been meaning to ask you Chris, can you get through a metal detector at the airport
   with out it going off?))
</p>
<p>
   Day 26-28: Write Hello World application
</p>
<p>
   Day 29: Try to figure out why Hello world application is not working
</p>
<p>
   Day 30-37: Learn the intricacies of Console.WriteLine and design some ASCII art for
   game
</p>
<p>
   Day 38: Have main character (aka "@" symbol) respond to keyboard events and move around
   the screen
</p>
<p>
   Day 39-40: Create a dragon that has "AI" that doesn't respond to any input
</p>
<p>
   Day 41: Get game compiling
</p>
<p>
   Day 42: Submit partially functional game, with partially working code, with Trash
   Talking posts as blogging progress, and with pretty colors to make game "fun"
</p>
<p>
   Day 43: Proclaim self winner
</p>
<p>
   Day 44: Lose
</p>
<p>
   Now, on the other hand, here is what George and I will be doing (or have already done):
</p>
<p>
   Day 1: Open up IDE, immediately ensuring victory over Chris
</p>
<p>
   Chris, if it makes you fell any better, I'm sure you could beat several monkeys if
   they entered the contest (okay, that might stretching it a bit, how 'bout dogs?).
