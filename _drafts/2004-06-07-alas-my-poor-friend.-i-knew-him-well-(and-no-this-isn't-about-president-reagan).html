title: Alas, my poor friend. I knew him well (and no, this isn't about President Reagan)

<P>You know, I had no clue that the sun started this horrible habit of getting up so early in the morning. Last time I checked with my friend, he was&nbsp;sleeping in until&nbsp;8 or 9 in the morning&nbsp;like I do. Obviously the coming spring must have thrown off his internal clock. My wife and I were up at around 2 or 3 (I can't remember, it was way too early to think about a stupid little thing like &#8220;what time is it?&#8221;) because our little poochie was having some problems. </P>
<P>Jazz (our little poochie, not the music genre) was having convulsions. Well, perhaps convulsions isn't the word. Every few seconds, her whole body would twitch. We were obviously startled, and being the neurotic parents we are currently, we&nbsp;decided to take&nbsp;her into the animal hospital. Well, Jazz must have picked up this bad habit from my wife, because by the time we got her in to be looked at, she stopped twitching and the doggie doctor couldn't find anything wrong. Go figure, $65 down the drain I suppose (although knowing our luck, if we wouldn't have taken her in, she would have ended up developing some kind of doggie Parkinson's disease). </P>
<P>Anyways, back to my friend, the sun. I thought my friend was living a healthy lifestyle (aka &#8220;Sleeping in&#8221; :~)). Obviously, I was wrong. To my surprise, he was up around 5am. Needless to say, he is not the alcoholic, party-after-work-and-don't-get-home-until-the-wee-hours-of-the-morning&nbsp;friend that I knew and loved from the good ol' Winter times. And if he is, Man!, he must have one killer hangover having to get up this early. (and as far as I know, there is no Planetary Maxwell House to help recover from his long, hard night of [#Insert Favorite Alcoholic Beverage Here#] glass lifting)</P>
<P>Oh, how I miss the good ol' days. My friend of days gone by, when will you return to me?</P><img src ="http://geekswithblogs.net/jolson/aggbug/6164.aspx" width = "1" height = "1" />
