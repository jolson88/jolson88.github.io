title: Spaceballs - Yay for GDI+
---

<p>
   Yay for GDI+ :). To create a rudimentary Sprite class (and we are talking *rudimentary*
   here) and&nbsp;hook in Rotation using a Matrix Transformation took less than 45 minutes
   (and most of that was cleanup refactoring and moving files around in SVN). 
</p>
<p>
   Now I'm very glad I dropped SDL.NET like a bad habit and moved over to GDI+. If you
   are doing 2d game programming in .NET, I do think that you might as well go the GDI+
   route and just forget about SDL.NET (at least for the graphics). With all the powerful
   code and classes in the .NET Framework (and how ironed out that code has become),
   you will be experience a lot less frustration, *trust me*. 
</p>
<p>
   I look at yesterday's update and I kind of have to laugh. No wonder Chris thought
   I was crazy :). After my change in direction, I myself am starting to realize just
   how easy this is (granted, it is just GDI+ and is no Gears of War :)). 
</p>
<p>
   If I could offer one piece of advice to any budding hobbyist developers out there,
   it would be to not put the cart in front of the horse. Don't try to do your first
   game directly against DirectX. While it is certainly possible, I think you would only
   cause your self grief in the long run. Now that there are great higher-level libraries
   at our disposal, there is no excuse to use them while you are just getting started
   in game programming.
</p>
<p>
   I'm only glad that I came to this realization/decision now instead of 30 days from
   now. 
</p>

   Oh, and if you _are_ a new guy on the scene of game development and are curious about
   all this GDI+ stuff I am talking about, I _strongly_ encourage you to look at the
   games you can find on Coding4Fun as part of the UpgradeYourGame Sweepstakes (basically
   Pong, Space Invaders, and a small RPG). And while you're at it, drop Andy "ZBuffer"
   Dunn a quick thank you over at <a href="http://www.thezbuffer.com/">The ZBuffer</a> for
   the work he did putting those together.
