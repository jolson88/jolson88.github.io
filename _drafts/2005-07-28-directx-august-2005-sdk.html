title: DirectX August 2005 SDK
---

<p>
   As Mykre has <a href="http://www.ircomm.net/blogs/system_announcements_and_news/archive/2005/07/29/483.aspx">already
   pointed out</a>, it appears that the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=136a7b29-aa12-4c3b-aa7d-15cd98a9a59c&amp;DisplayLang=en">August
   2005 SDK</a> has been released. I'm not sure how "official" it is since it isn't reflected
   on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx">DirectX community</a> site, or
   the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/sdk">latest SDK</a> page yet (although
   that may change by the time you actually read this post).
</p>
<p>
   Enjoy!
