title: Spaceballs - Day 20 - Screens, States, and Transitions, Oh My!
---

 <p>
   I didn't quite get around to implementing the lives functionality tonight. However,
   I did do some general cleanup and "paved the road" for me to easily drop in the code
   for respawning and multiple lives tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
   One of the refactorings I did was to take what I was calling "States" before and change
   them to "Screens". Really, they were screens. As I needed to start adding states to
   the gameplay itself (like PlayingState, LostLifeState, etc.), I didn't want to go
   down the road of making a hierarchical state manager because I felt it would muddle
   up what was really being done under the hood. I felt that separating out Screens from
   States would lead to a much more clean implementation.
</p>
<p>
   Rather than states being things like MenuState, PlayState, RecapState, and HighScoreState,
   those are now MenuScreen, PlayScreen, RecapScreen, and HighScoreScreen. In my mind,
   that makes it much more clear what they are actually doing. States are now concepts
   like ReadyToPlayState, PlayingState, LostLifeState, PowerUpState, GameOverState, etc.
   Once again, I am happy about this change as I am really liking the separation between
   "Screens" and "States" rather than hacking both concepts into one. The code is not
   only cleaner, but it will also be much more clear where the functionality I'm about
   to implement goes. For instance, the multiple lives functionality will simply be transitions
   from PlayingState to LostLifeState and back to PlayingState. If I add the "countdown"
   at the beginning of the game (think "Starting in 3... 2... 1.... GO!"), it will simply
   be starting with ReadyToPlayState and transitioning to PlayingState when appropriate.
   This will also help break out the code into more manageable chunks as well (which
   I always like).
</p>
<p>
   On an aside, I think I use Source Control much more than I originally thought. It's
   only day 20, and I'm already up to revision 61 in SVN (61 commits). Better safe than
   sorry, I suppose :).
</p>

   I still don't have any comments to make on Visual C# Express. I still haven't really
   noticed the difference all that much for my hobbyist development. Anyone out there
   that wants to get into C# development should _totally_ download Visual C# Express
   and use that. Besides, you can't beat the price of FREE :). The one thing that I can
   say is that, in my opinion, the Express products are better than the other free IDEs
   that are out there today. Usually, you get what you pay for (meaning free can suck
   tremendously), but not with the Express editions.
</p>
<p>
   That's it for this update. For tomorrow night, I'm going to shoot for implementing
   multiple lives (a.k.a. LostLifeState) and hopefully get around to implementing the
   ReadyToPlayState as well to add the countdown to play time. Those shouldn't take too
   long (hence the reason I'm hoping I can get both of them done tomorrow night). Until
   then, I'll see you on the flip side :).
